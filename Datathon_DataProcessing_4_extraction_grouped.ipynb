The Hong Kong Health department, in a statement this week, said two people in mainland China are in a \"critical condition\" in hospital after contracting H5N6 avian influenza, The Telegraph reported. A 68-year-old man from Sichuan Province and a 55-year-old woman from Zhejiang provinces, were found to have the virus. Both infections occurred earlier this month, the report said. As per authorities, it is not yet clear how the man, who fell ill on January 3, became infected, but the woman developed symptoms on January 6 after being exposed to slaughtered poultry. Early this month, a person living in the South West of England also contracted avian influenza, after being in regular contact with a large number of infected birds, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), had said. H5N6 was first detected in people in 2014, and since then 67 cases have been detected - all but one in China. However, the rate appears to be rising: more than half of human infections have been reported in the last six months, including four so far this year. \"It\\'s a bad year for avian flu generally, (but it\\'s) not really clear why,\" Ian Jones, a professor of virology at the University of Reading, was quotedA as saying to The Telegraph. He said the rise in H5N6 \"might signify a change that makes it more infectious for people\", although stressed he has not yet seen any evidence of human to human transmission. \"So it seems to be classic bird flu in that regard, not a harbinger of anything worse,\" he said. \"But it does need watching.\" Although the virus mainly affects birds it occasionally jumps to humans, especially those in close contact with poultry, and the death rate is as high as 50 per cent. The World Organization for Animal Health (or OIE) said it has seen a significant increase in reports with various subtypes - including H5N1, H5N6 and H5N8 - found in well over 40 countries. \"Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected,\" added a spokesperson from the World Health Organization. \"WHO recommends Member States to remain vigilant and consider mitigation steps to reduce human exposure to potentially infected birds to reduce risk of additional zoonotic infection.\" (IANS)  Join and get latest news updates delivered to you via WhatsApp\\n  Subscribe to our Newsletter!'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-01-30 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'avian influenza/unspecified', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': '2 people in China contract avian influenza - Symaman', 'Translated_Content': 'Error 404: Unable to fetch content'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-01-30 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'avian influenza/unspecified', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'Bird flu in China....?

It can die after 2 hours of drying or at 55 ° C temperature, and immediately die.The O1 group and the O139 group of cholera are the main pathogens of cholera.The most common cause of infection in the existence of cholera is the water contaminated by the feces that is contaminated by patients, that is, it is mainly transmitted through the dung portal.Hoothye can produce cholera toxins and cause secretion diarrhea.Chang Rongshan, a virusist, told Peng Mei News that the epidemic of cholera is related to the pathogenicity of the flora. For example, the cholera toxins and pathogenicity produced by the O1 group and the O139 group are also related to the number of cholera.O1 and O139 group choice can be divided into strains and non -strains.Choisystotoxin is the main pathogenic factor of cholera.The choleraxotoxin genes carried by cholera have affected the propagation power; the toxic gene negatives of the O139 strains discovered by Wuhan University this time, the propagation power is weak, and the possibility of popularity is small.As a parasitic creature, the survival of cholera in the external environment is limited, and humans are its only host.He believes that the four turtles are positive in the above -mentioned report content, indicating that turtles are contaminated by cholera, but the use of chlorine -containing disinfection agents can easily eliminate disinfecting.“一般来说水产品带产毒霍乱弧菌的情况少见，而带非产毒株的情况比较常见。”  常荣山还指出，一般自然界的河水、塘水、井水、海水中，O1和The O139 group can survive for 1 to 3 weeks or even longer.The survival time of cholera in water depends on many factors, such as the biological type of the strain, the amount of contaminated bacteria, the temperature of the water, the degree of acid and alkali, and the content of the bacteria in the water, the content of salt and organic matter.In the rivers in a region, it was found that popular plants survived for 49 days, not popular strains but could survive for 143 days.When there are creatures such as algae or crustacean in the water body, the survival period is longer.However, if water contains a large amount of other bacteria, the time of viala for cholera is greatly shortened, which is an interesting microbial ecological competition phenomenon.\"Unlike the parasitic method of the virus, cholera bacteria will not be parasitic in the aquatic creature, and it cannot be breeded and will not detoxify.\" Choiber is mostly distributed in the country. It is mostly coastal.Surging news noticed that many parts of my country have formulated local choice monitoring plans, and regularly carry out the monitoring and investigation and analysis of aquatic products and water -based cholera in the jurisdiction.For example, in June 2010, the \"Investigation and Analysis of the Pollution of Herbal and Aquatic Vibrio Vibrio Vibrio Pollution Pollution in Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province\", which was published in the journal magazine \"Disease Control Monitoring\" in June 2010, was based on farms and markets collected from May to October, 2008Sampled to the sea and aquatic products sold, it is found that the maritime and aquatic cholera bacteria band in Zhangzhou City is 5.08%(26/512), of which the frog band rate is 25.00%(13/52).Poisonous strains, but the potential factors of the popularity of cholera still exist.As of now, seven cholera has occurred around the world, and it is still in the seventh popularity worldwide.The disease is one of the international quarantine infectious diseases stipulated in the International Health Regulations, and it is also one of the \"compulsory management\" of \"mandatory management\" in the \"Prevention and Control Law of the People\\'s Republic of China\".The epidemic time of cholera in China is March-November, the peak of the disease is in summer and autumn, and the peak of popularity from June-September.In recent years, there have been reports of cholera every year in my country, but none of them have caused popularity.Before Wuhan University appeared in a cholene case, there were 2 cholene cases in the first half of this year in my country.

On October 17th, the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued news. When tracing the Qingdao epidemic, the China CDC was detected from the foreign packaging positive samples of the imported frozen cod carried by the workers.Live virus.This confirms that the external packaging contaminated by the new crown virus can cause infection.On October 18th, the traceability of Wang Mou, who was asymptomatic in Guangzhou, also concluded that Wang\\'s infected virus gene sequence was highly homologous to the virus gene sequence of virus genes found by the isolation hotel where it worked.A infection stems from an overseas input case of isolated hotels.Since the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, the Northeast China (Suifenhe and Jilin Shilan), Beijing Xinfa, Xinjiang Urumqi, Dalian, Liaoning, and Qingdao, Shandong have successively appeared in small -scale clustering cases.What did the traceable survey discovered during the outbreak of the local outbreak?In the situation of exceeding 40 million confirmed cases around the world, and new cases of new cases in a single day, what should my country\\'s epidemic prevention and control should pay special attention to and prevent?The reporter interviewed experts from the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The new coronal virus triggered the epidemic in October 11 with cold chain items as a carrier. On October 11, 3 cases of new coronary pneumonia were infected with no symptoms in Qingdao City, Shandong Province.Where does the sudden new crown virus come from the attention of all parties?After 72 consecutive hours of investigation, the \"case\" finally came out: During the quarantine observation of the two new crown virus in Qingdao Port, the two new -crown virus infected from Qingdao\\'s thoracic hospital left the closed ward for CT examination.The virus is contaminated, and then the inpatients and accompanying patients in the tuberculosis areas who have been checked in the same CT room the next day, and the virus belt is included in the tuberculosis ward, which causes the epidemic to spread in the hospital.As the \"zero patient\" of the Qingdao epidemic, Dong Moumou and Chen Moumou were the loading and unloading workers in Qingdao Dagang. On September 19th, the frozen seafood imported from overseas was loaded.The Qingdao Center for Disease Control and Prevention samples the working environment of the two.According to the samples they collected, experts from the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Center detect the live virus from the outer packaging positive samples of the imported frozen cod by the workers.In June of this year, after 56 consecutive days of adding local diagnosis cases in Beijing, local cases appeared again, and the infection of \"source\" was locked as the newly distributed agricultural wholesale market; in July, Dalian has not added local diagnosis for more than 100 days in a row for more than 100 days.Local cases appeared after the case. Nearly 80 % of the confirmed cases in the first five days were employees and family members of Kaiyang Seafood Company.Experts analyze that frozen -stored polluting import sea products are likely to play an important role in the trigger and spread of the two places.However, although the epidemic traceability survey was detected, the relevant items of cold chain aquatic products and the positive samples of the outer packaging nucleic acid were detected, but the live virus was never separated, and the transmission chain and the evidence chain were not complete.This time from Qingdao Cold Chain Foods, the virus is separated from the international internationally internationally.This suggests that the new coronal virus can be cold -chain items as the carrier of long -distance cross -border input, and also confirmed that the outer packaging contaminated by the new crown virus can cause infection.\"In the past, the \\'coronary virus nucleic acid was positive in the sample. Nucleic acid positive is not necessarily a living virus.Director Gao Fu said.\"The separation virus from the outer packaging of cold chain food has two significance from a scientific perspective: First, it can show that the new crown virus can survive for a long time in the physical environment of the cold chain outer packaging, so that the virus can be across this carrier across this carrier across this carrier.The situation input caused the spread of the epidemic; the second is to provide the most direct scientific basis for triggering the new crown or clustered epidemic in food and outer packaging that are contaminated by the new crown virus and cross -border transportation through the cold chain.Wu Zunyou, the chief expert of Xuexue, explained that the main way to spread the new crown virus is still through the respiratory tract droplet and close contact.In the place, the virus is brought in by pollutants. People have a new \"Zero Case\" due to contact with pollutants, thereby triggering a clustered new crown epidemic or outbreak.After triggering the epidemic, the main way of spreading the spread of epidemic is the rumor (through the droplets).Liu Peipei, deputy director of the P3 Laboratory of the China Disease Control and Prevention Center, who participated in the separation of the virus of the Qingdao epidemic and environmental sample virus, explained whether it can be separated from the virus and affected by various factors, including the pollution of items, the items were transported from overseas to domestic abroadTime, etc., \"For example, moving seafood from frozen cars to frozen libraries usually pass through the normal temperature environment. It is colder than in June and July in 9 October. The virus survival time will grow.Some\".Since the epidemic occurred, Qingdao immediately organized a large -scale flow inspection and classification test.The picture shows Qingdao Red Wheat Island Change testing point, and citizens are lined up in an orderly manner for nucleic acid testing.According to Li Zhongjie, a researcher at the Infectious Division of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are three characteristics of the Qingdao epidemic: one is that the virus comes from overseas input, which is the same communication chain; the other is to occur in specific places, which is limited to the scope; and third, case discovery is quickly disposed of quickly in time.It did not cause community communication.Wu Zunyou also pointed out that the particularity of the Qingdao epidemic is that the first two people who were infected did not cause the epidemic to spread a larger scope in the cold chain industry.This also helps to eliminate other possibilities about the source of the epidemic, and it is confirmed that the epidemic is caused by the transportation of seafood that is transported to the country through the cold chain.External defense input should emphasize the separation virus from the outer packaging of the \"character\" from the cold chain food. What does this mean?\"This shows that our external defense input and the prevention and control strategy of internal defense rebound are correct.\" Wu Zunyou explained that foreign defense input emphasizes that \"characters are equal\", that is, people who prevent overseas infection must be prevented from returning to the country to cause local transmission and diffusionIt is obviously extremely necessary to prevent freezing freezing foods from transporting freezing foods overseas through cold chain transportation.The separation virus is on the outer packaging of freezing cod, and imported seafood has attracted special attention.Wu Zunyou reminded that this does not mean that meat food imported through cold chains does not bring the risk of virus.\"Earlier, many meat and food processing companies in Europe and the United States have developed a clustered epidemic. If they do not regulate epidemic prevention when re -production, beef and mutton and chicken imported from the country from overseas epidemic conditions may also be transported by cold chain transportation.In China, the detection of meat food should not be relaxed. \"Wu Zunyou said.For ordinary people, can import sea products and meat foods still eat?Experts from the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that the new crown virus possibility of cold chain items as a carrier has a long -range cross -border input, but the people infected by the risk of infection are mainly cold chain items practitioners, such as people engaged in cold chain products loading and unloading, processing, sales, etc.The risk of infection of ordinary public contact or consumption of cold chain food is extremely low.The data released by the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the risk of being contaminated with new crown virus in my country\\'s market circulation was very low.As of September 15, 24 provinces across the country reported to 2.98 million test results, including 670,000 cold chain food and packaging samples, 1.24 million samples of employees, 1.07 million environmental samples, only 22 foods and packaging packagesThe new coronary virus nucleic acid was positive, and the virus nucleic acid load was low.\"Live viruses, dead viruses, and virus fragments can detect nucleic acid positive, but only the living virus is contagious. 22 nucleic acid positives were detected from 2.98 million copies, and there was no separate virus.The risk of infectious epidemic can be ignored. \"Wu Zunyou reminded that if you are still not assured, you can also be more careful, such as paying attention to the separation of raw food and cooked food, do not mix in chopping boards;Before touching the mouth, mouth, nose and eyes.For industry employees who often closely contact with cold chain products with high new coronary virus pollution in the work, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that they strengthen their awareness of protection and do daily protection.For example, to avoid the skin that may be contaminated directly in the skin. After contacting the cold chain products, it does not take off the pollution -oriented workwear and do not touch the nose and eyes before washing the hands. After the work is completed, you need to wash your hands and disinfect it.Strengthen the closed -loop management of overseas input cases so that the ward isolates. Recently, the Shandong Yantai border inspection organs shall handle border inspection procedures for 400,000 tons of giant wheels from Brazil based on the prevention and control of the epidemic.In response to the situation of more than 20 Chinese crew members in the round, the border inspection agencies sent multiple groups of duty personnel to check the personnel inspection of the boarding crew members to ensure that the shipping crew can receive nucleic acid testing as soon as possible.At present, the world is still in a peak period, and new cases have been newly high in a single day.Data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States show that as of the early morning of October 20, Beijing time, a total of more than 40.15 million cumulative cases in the world have exceeded 1.15 million cases.In the past 7 days, more than 2.5 million newly confirmed cases of various countries are the highest weekly new numbers since the emergence of new crown pneumonia.According to the new crown epidemic data released by the World Health Organization, as of 1:43 on October 18, Beijing time, the number of new crowns in the world increased by 392,471 cases from the previous day.New high.The World Health Organization Director -General Tan Desai said at a regular press conference that as the northern hemisphere enters the winter, the new crowns in many places have accelerated, especially in Europe and North America.\"At present, the second wave of epidemic rebound in the world is obvious. Foreign defense input is the focus of the current epidemic prevention and control. Autumn and winter is the season of high incidence of respiratory infectious diseases. The prevention and control situation is even more severe.Blessing.Recently, the local epidemic has exposed shortcomings and loopholes in the prevention and control of the normalized epidemic.For example, Qingdao\\'s new crown virus infection shares the CT room with patients with ordinary ward.For another example, Wang Hua\\'s infection was infected without any symptoms in Guangzhou because he did not carry out protection in accordance with the specifications when assisting parts of the isolation of the hotel.It is not standardized and has a close communication with the isolated persons.\"At present, China\\'s social environment should be said to be safer, only new crown viruses like customs, hospitals, and laboratories. Pay special attention to the following risk points to prevent and control.\" Wu Zunyou reminded that the closed loop of input cases overseas should be entered overseas cases.In terms of management, we must pay attention to the isolation of the diseased area to prevent the risk of cross -infection.The management of overseas input cases in various places has a designated hospital or designated hospital. Some designated hospitals are specially received for new crown cases, and there are also services to other patients in society while receiving new crown input cases.In the latter case, pay attention to whether the division of the ward area is strictly isolated, whether large instrument and equipment are used in cross use, and all localities must conduct one -stop examination of hospitals receiving input cases to see if there is a loophole in the entire closed loop.In terms of laboratory protection, the laboratory operation should be performed in accordance with regulations. At the same time, there must be a hidden danger of the closed loop of the epidemic prevention and control., Wearing masks, washing hands, and maintaining social distance is still important.New crown virus infections that have recently appeared in local areas, such as Qingdao Port workers Dong Moumou and Chen Moumou, and Wang Mou, who are infected with Guangzhou, are asymptomatic. What does this mean?Wu Zunyou explained that in the early days of the epidemic at the beginning of this year, people were more concerned about the timely extinguishing the epidemic and treating patients.Among the subsequent epidemics, the proportion of asymptomatic infections increased. This is actually due to the movement of the epidemic prevention and control window and the improvement of the detection capacity, so that we can find cases in the early infection in a timely manner.\"After more than 9 months of practice, my country has accumulated effective early prevention and control experience. Even if there is an epidemic, there will be no serious epidemic like Wuhan in the early days of Wuhan. We have the confidence to deal with the test of the autumn and winter epidemic.\" Wu Zunyou explain.The new idea of \\u200b\\u200bproviding new ideas for the mystery of the traceability of the new crown virus has lasted for a long time without local reports.Expert analysis pointed out two possibilities: one is that infected people from the epidemic area cause input transmission; the other is that the polluted seafood or meat foods are transported to the domestic market through the cold chain.\"The epidemic situation in several cities in Northeast China in April and May basically belongs to the local communication caused by input cases. Beijing, Dalian, Qingdao and other local epidemic conditions are basically transported from the polluted seafood or outer packaging through the cold chain to the cold chain to the cold chain to the cold chain to the cold chain to\"Wu Zunyou said in China.Earlier, a large number of new crown viruses were detected in the South China seafood market, and people had suspected that the epidemic was related to wild animals.However, with the deepening of the understanding of the new crown virus, experts believe that it is necessary to further broaden their ideas and incorporate some new technical directions into the research scope.In June this year, the epidemic rebounded in Beijing, and it was also concentrated in the wholesale market. However, the possibility of wild animals caused the epidemic in Beijing, and the survey of the epidemic traceability finally pointed to the cold chain food.Since then, the epidemic in Dalian and Qingdao has been related to seafood.\"Early surveys in Wuhan, cases in the South China Seafood Market are also concentrated in practitioners in the sea product sales area. In the past, our virus trace the source of more considering wild animals. Today, some new epidemiology data and laboratory data remind us.In addition to the previous technical lines, the virus traceability should also be considered to consider new lines, such as whether seafood is possible.(Han Yadong, the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection)'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2020-10-24 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'China - 28 new confirmed COVID-19 coronavirus cases announced for October 23, 2020 - All imported (as usual)', 'Translated_Content': nan}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2020-10-24 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'China - 28 new confirmed COVID-19 coronavirus cases announced for October 23, 2020 - All imported (as usual)', 'Translated_Content': nan}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2020-10-24 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'China -  A case of asymptomatic COVID-19 coronavirus infection was reported in Shufu County, Kashgar Prefecture, Xinjiang - October 24, 2020', 'Translated_Content': nan}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2020-10-24 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'China - Screening for COVID-19 coronavirus: Shenzhen takes the lead in setting up a centralized supervision warehouse for imported frozen products in the country - October 24, 2020', 'Translated_Content': nan}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2020-10-24 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'China - Screening for COVID-19 coronavirus: Shenzhen takes the lead in setting up a centralized supervision warehouse for imported frozen products in the country - October 24, 2020', 'Translated_Content': nan}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2020-10-24 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'The latest situation of the outbreak of new coronavirus pneumonia as of 24 hours on 23 October;', 'Translated_Content': nan}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2020-10-24 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'The latest situation of the outbreak of new coronavirus pneumonia as of 24 hours on 23 October;', 'Translated_Content': nan}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2020-10-26 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': '5 new confirmed cases of imported new crown pneumonia in Shanghai;', 'Translated_Content': 'China News Service, October 25.

She took off the mask to eat and drink water when she boarded the plane, which could cause herself to be infected.The results of gene sequencing on December 24 showed that the virus strain was different from the previously tested virus strains. After further research, it was confirmed that the patient had a variant virus found in the UK earlier.It is reported that in order to minimize the risk of mutant virus spread, Shanghai has taken a number of measures, including strengthening the tracking of close contact with patients.As my country\\'s epidemic is effectively controlled, the input of the new coronal virus is still a major risk of my country\\'s epidemic prevention work.In the past few months, strict measures have been taken in various places to prevent viruses from entering passengers and cargo input.WHO reports four variations of viruses on the evening of December 31, 2020, local time, WHO officially notified the main mutation since the emergence of the new crown virus, including four variants.From the end of January 2020 to early February, D614G mutations occurred in the new coronary virus.By June 2020, the variant became the main type of new crown virus in the world.Compared with initial strains, the variant is more infectious and transmitted, but it will not cause more serious diseases, nor will it affect the effectiveness of existing diagnosis and vaccine measures.From August to September 2020, Denmark found a new crown virus variant related to mink, named \"Cluster 5\" by relevant Danish departments.According to preliminary research, the variant may reduce the scope and duration of immune protection after natural infection or vaccination, and the relevant evaluation is still ongoing.At present, Denmark has discovered 12 cases of human infection in this variant in September 2020, and the variant does not seem to spread widely.On December 14, 2020, the British reported a new crown virus variant named \"VOC 202012/01\", which first appeared in southeast England.Preliminary studies have shown that the variant has stronger communication, but the severity and re -infection of the disease caused by it have not changed, and most diagnostic tools are not affected.As of December 30, 2020, 31 other countries and regions have discovered this variant.On December 18, 2020, South Africa detected a new coronal virus variant, and N501Y mutations appeared. South Africa named it \"501y.v2\" variants. The variant was rapidly spreading in three provinces in South Africa.Preliminary studies have shown that the variant is related to the higher virus load and may increase infectivity, but there is no evidence that it will cause more serious diseases and still need to conduct further investigations to understand the transmission of the virus to the virus.The effects of diagnosis, vaccine and other aspects.As of December 30, 2020, the variant of 4 countries outside South Africa was found.WHO stated that all viruses will change with time, and most mutations will not cause the virus to increase in contagious, and sometimes even limit its spread.The WHO also emphasized that although the initial assessment shows that the mutant new crown virus discovered by the United Kingdom and South Africa will not increase the severity of the disease, it will lead to a higher incidence. Therefore, stricter public health measures need to be taken to control the spread of mutant viruses.Expert: Without evidence, it is worth mentioning that the mutation will have an impact on the effect of the vaccine. On December 31, the joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council was released.It will be provided for free for the whole people.Among them, for the mutant virus discovered by the United Kingdom, Xu Nanping, deputy minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology, said that the scientific research and research team held a number of expert research and judgment meetings, and combined with some previous research results, whether the mutation of the virus affects the effect of vaccine use.Research.As a result of the expert\\'s judgment, there is no evidence to prove that the mutation we observed will have a substantial impact on the effect of the vaccine.Source: Dongfang.com Editor-in-chief: Zhang Mei 24-hour rolling broadcast the latest financial information and videos, more fan welfare scanning QR code attention (SinaFinance) Sina Finance Opinion Feedback Message Board: 400-052-0066 Welcome to criticize and correct criticism\\nIntroduction to Sina | Advertising Service | About Sina\\n\\nContact Us | Recruitment Information | Public Permit Registration\\n\\nProduct answer | Website lawyer | Sina English\\nCopyright © 1996-2021 Sina Corporation All Rights Reserve Sina Company Copyright'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2021-01-03 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'National Health And Wellness Commission: 2 new crown pneumonia confirmed cases of 24 cases of which 8 cases of local;', 'Translated_Content': \"Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 3r The National Health and Health Committee reported on the 3rd that from 0 to 24:00 on January 2, 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 24 cases of new new crown pneumonia.16 cases of input cases (6 cases in Shanghai, 2 cases in Fujian, 2 cases in Guangdong, 2 cases in Shaanxi, 1 case in Beijing, 1 case of Tianjin, 1 case of 1 case in Inner Mongolia, 1 case of Liaoning), 8 cases of local cases (4 cases in Heilongjiang, 2 cases of 2 cases in Liaoning1 case in Beijing, 1 case of Hebei); no new death case; no new suspected cases.12 cases of newly cured hospitals on the day, 960 close contacts of medical observations were lifted, and severe cases were reduced by 1 case from the previous day.279 cases of existing confirmed cases were entered overseas (3 of them), and 1 case of suspected cases.A total of 4,303 confirmed cases, 4,024 cases of cure for hospitalization, and no death cases.As of 24:00 on January 2nd, according to the reports of 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, 395 cases of confirmed cases (including 9 of them), 82088 cases of cumulative cases, and 4634 cases of deaths.There were 87,117 confirmed cases, and there were 1 cases of suspected cases.A total of 90,7460 people were tracked to the close contact, and 14,175 close contacts were still observed in medical observation.31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 8 asymptomatic infected infections (all of them were inputs overseas); 5 cases were turned to confirmed cases on the same day; 14 cases were terminated on that day (14 cases of medical observation (Enter 11 cases overseas); 269 cases of disagreals were still observed in medical observation (225 cases were entered overseas).A total of 9,777 confirmed cases were notified in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.Among them, 8,923 cases of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (7,968 cases were discharged from the hospital, 150 deaths), and 46 cases of 46 cases of the Macau Special Administrative Region (46 cases were discharged), and 808 cases in Taiwan (686 were discharged from hospital and 7 deaths).Related links: On the 2nd, Heilongjiang Province added new crown pneumonia.

After consultation with clinical experts, diagnosed as asymptomatic infected.On January 16, the asymptomatic infected person converted into a confirmed case.The asymptomatic infection\\'s respiratory virus is not necessarily less than that of symptoms. \"The respiratory virus of asymptomatic infection is not necessarily less than that of symptoms.\" In this regard, Li Yan, deputy chief physician of the infection department of Beijing Youan Hospital, said thatThe ability of the new coronal virus to infected depends on the amount of virus volume and the ability to spread infectious droplets.The reason why asymptomatic infection is weak because there are some symptoms such as cough and phlegm, and there are fewer viruses from the respiratory tract.\"On the whole, in addition to the spread of droplets, it also depends on the space and environment when contacting people. The temperature and humidity also affect the infection.\" Director Li Yan said that if there are relatively closed spaces, such as elevators, compartments, compartments, compartments, compartment,In the room, when the personnel gather, multiple people may be transmitted.Because the super communicationer of the Jilin epidemic is a training lecturer, asymptomatic infected people do not cough, but viruses will also be excreted when they speak.\"In fact, the asymptomatic infected and mild infection are actually prone to breakthrough. Some people feel that there is no symptoms in a slight cough in itchy and slightly cough. It may be like this.Itching and painful cough can be diagnosed with mild infection, which is actually very common. \"Director Li Yan said.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of now, more than half of the new crown -infected people in the United States have been caused by the spread of non -symptoms, and the power of dissemination of asymptomatic infections has also changed.\"The previous virus may be different from the current virus. Virus variation may cause an enhancement of the spread.\" Zhang Hongtao, associate professor of the Department of Pathology and Experimental Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, said that once the virus is infected with the human body, each person\\'s symptoms are also different.Different, the release of the virus is not the same, which depends on personal immunity.He emphasized that inoculation of new crown vaccines is currently the most effective way.Careers with more people should be vaccinated first. The possibility of infection of vaccine is reduced, and the possibility of spreading will be reduced.Earlier, Feng Zijian, deputy director of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, introduced that a considerable proportion of people in the infection of new crown pneumonia did not spread and would not cause second -generation cases; but the number of transmission of a small number of infected people or patients exceeded the number of basic transmission--3 or above, more than 3 second -generation cases will be spread, which constitutes a super communication phenomenon, which is a very important feature of the new crown.He said that the new crown pneumonia is a very prominent disease of the super communication phenomenon, and reducing clustering activities is an important measure to eliminate the phenomenon of super communication.Copyright and Disclaimer Copyright Statement: All the sources are the manuscripts of \"intersection point, Xinhua Daily and its subsidiary\" or \"Xinhua Newspaper Network\".Mirror; authorization reprint must indicate the source of the \"Xinhua Newspaper Network\" and retain the electrode of \"Xinhua Newspaper\".Disclaimer: This site reprinted the manuscript only represents the author\\'s personal point of view, which has nothing to do with Xinhua Newspaper.Its originality and the text and content stated in the text have not been confirmed by this site, and the authenticity, integrity, and timelyness of this article and part of the content and part of the content and part of the text will not be guaranteed or promised.Credit related content by yourself.Contact us │ illegal and bad information reports │ Jiangsu Xinhua Newspaper Media Group Co., Ltd.

At 0-24 on June 2, 15 new local diagnosis cases were added in Guangdong Province, 4 of which were for asymptomatic infections.There are 5 symptoms of local infections.At this point, in just 12 days, 95 newly infected people in Guangdong Province (local confirmed cases+asymptomatic infected infected infected).① The first patient in Guangzhou has been passed on to 15 generations!This epidemic, represented by Guangzhou Morning Tea Communication Chain and spread to the epidemic in Maoming and Foshan.Guo, who was 75 -year -old in the first case of the epidemic report on May 21, was used as an example. After two days of diagnosis, her husband was judged as asymptomatic infection.On May 25, Yao, who had delivered food for Guo at the morning tea dots and was diagnosed with Yao, who lived in Maoming, Guangdong.On May 26th, Song Moumou, Guangzhou, confirmed. Song Moumou had a morning tea with Guo at the same time on the 19th.People are judged to be infected.On May 26, Song Moumou\\'s husband and a staff member who had dinner at Qixian restaurant at the same time as Song Moumou were determined to be infected.On May 27th and 28th, at least 4 infected cases in Guangzhou were related to Song Moumou and his family.And Foshan\\'s first asymptomatic infection is the close contact with Song Moumou\\'s daughter -in -law Lei Moumou.The even shocking spread is that in the notification of new cases on May 29, two new cases in Guangzhou have two cases related to Song Moumou and his family.In other words, if Guo was calculated as a generation of cases discovered as a generation of cases, the virus has been spread to the fourth generation, which is related to Guo, and the number of infections caused by it has reached 15.② 1.At the press conference of the Guangzhou Epidemic Prevention and Control of the Guangzhou Epidemium on the afternoon of May 31st, the deputy mayor of the Guangzhou Municipal People\\'s Government, the deputy mayor of the Guangzhou Municipal People\\'s Government, said that after the recent rapid and dense investigation, the basic circle has been disseminated.Track.The virus gene sequencing of all infected people in this epidemic is highly homologous, and the infected variable strains found in India. The strain has the characteristics of short latent period, fast transmission speed, and high virus load.\"Indian mutant strains have been spreading fast, the average incubation period of cases is 2 to 4 days, and the virus load is large, and the CT value of the nucleic acid is around 20. These have caused the speed of intergenerational propagation, the three are superimposed, making the epidemic develop rapidly.Zhang Zhoubin, deputy director of the Guangzhou Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, summarized at a press conference.③ Wang Guiqiang, a member of the expert group of the National Health and Health Commission and the director of the Department of Infectious Diseases of the First Hospital of Peking University, analyzed in an interview with \"China News Weekly\" that the CT value is a sign of the high and low concentration of local virus and strong infectivity.Low, the higher the virus concentration, the stronger the infectiousness.Under normal circumstances, the CT value is more common between 25-30, and the infectivity of 30 or more is weak.In general, the CT value is 20 means that the virus load is high.2.The effect of vaccine prevention and severe illness is very prominent. From May 21st, the first case of \"Guo\" was diagnosed with local cases in Guangzhou.There are more than 50 cases of symptoms.On June 2, Lei Chunliang, Dean of the Eighth Hospital of the Affiliated City of Guangzhou Medical University, introduced in detail the relevant situation. Statistics show that of more than 50 local cases, 3 patients were seriously ill.The average age is 49.1 years old, with a heavy and dangerous average age of 67.8 years.According to clinical observations, he found that there are four main characteristics of local cases in the epidemic: 1.Infected people generally have high virus load; 2.Virus has strong communication ability; 3.The patient\\'s condition has progressed rapidly and the incubation period is very short; 4.Nucleic acid has a long time.It is also worth noting that in this local infection case, four patients injected the first new crown vaccine, and they were infected before they had time.Lei Chunliang said: \"At present, it is found that as long as the vaccine is vaccinated, even if the two pins are not completed, the basic condition is not serious. The results of clinical feedback show that the effect of vaccine prevention is very prominent.\"It has become more and more \"influenza\"!On May 30, at the academic report meeting of the seventh academic annual conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, when it was time to return to normal life, Gao Fu, director of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that the new crown epidemic is increasingly presented to the characteristics of influenzaization.It may be to live with viruses peacefully and get used to such a life slowly.\"After we are used to influenza, influenza will occur every year, and it is called normal life,\" Gao Fu said. Because vaccine injection establishes group immunity, it will no longer prevent infection with new crown pneumoniaDisease burden.When it comes to the traceability of the new crown virus, Gao Fu believes that scientific issues need to be \"cold bench\" for a period of time to answer.Historically, the flu virus took nearly 70 years to complete the traceability work. This virus originally existed in the water birds. It was infected with chickens and ducks, and then infected with pigs.\"If you can\\'t go back according to the theory of flu,\" Gao Fu explained that the natural host and middle host of the new crown virus have not yet been found.\"After this virus comes out, there are many many virusists, and the information epidemic is also serious.\" Gao Fu said that some of the previous studies in the virus found in batteries such as bats, pangolins, \"I am responsible for telling everyone to study one to study one\"More years\", these viruses are not directly related to the new coronal virus infected by human infection, but there are very close evolutionary connections.Talking about the current epidemic prevention and control measures, Gao Fu gave three keywords to enclose, suppress and slow.\"China uses this method well,\" he said that if the world is in accordance with Chinese methods, there will be hope of eliminating or eliminating the new crown virus.In his opinion, biological safety issues represented by infectious diseases are not only national security, but also about global security.\"We must cooperate, cooperate in competition, we must communicate, and we must coordinate,\" he emphasized. \"If we do not share the vaccine, the virus will share the world.\" ⑤ Academician Zhong NanshanOn May 19, Academician Zhong Nanshan said in an interview with China International TV CGTN, \"If the impact of the new crown on human health is slowly reduced, the long -term coexistence of the new crown and human beings will become possible.Vaccine. In view of virus mutations in many countries, the specific development still needs to be seen. \"\\nReport mailbox: jubao@vip.sina.com Copyright © 1996-2021 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserve Sina Company All rights reserved'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2021-06-03 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'Foshan, an old and small family of four people all turned into confirmed cases;', 'Translated_Content': 'According to the report of the Foshan City Health Commission in Guangdong Province, at 0:00 on June 1, 2021, Foshan City, Guangdong Province, reported 3 cases of asymptomatic infected cases in the country.Add 1 new case to input confirmed cases.As of 24:00 on June 1, Foshan City reported a total of 145 confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia (50 cases of input overseas).There are currently 10 cases in the hospital (4 cases of input overseas), without death cases.Anyone who is asymptomatic infected to the confirmed case is as follows: No. 1 asymptomatic infection Turn to the confirmed case: Male, 31 years old, now live in Huafu Royal Waterfront, Guicheng Street, Nanhai District, Foshan City.For those.On June 1, symptoms of fever and cough occurred, after further examination and expert consultation, diagnosed as a confirmed case.Anymalized case of non -symptoms 2: Female, 31 years old, now lives in Huafu Royal Waterfront Community, Guicheng Street, Nanhai District, Foshan City.On June 1, symptoms of fever and cough occurred, after further examination and expert consultation, diagnosed as a confirmed case.Anymalized case of non -symptoms in the number 3: Female, 46 years old, now lives in Huafu Royal Waterfront Community, Guicheng Street, Nanhai District, Foshan City.On June 1, symptoms of fever and cough occurred, after further examination and expert consultation, diagnosed as a confirmed case.The situation of newly added overseas input diagnostic cases is as follows: Female, 37 years old, departed from the Philippines on May 18 to take a flight 5J308 to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport on the same day.After the customs are sampled, transfer to the concentrated isolation point according to the full closed -loop management program.During the concentrated isolation period, the positive of the new crown virus nucleic acid, that is, isolation treatment of the Fourth People\\'s Hospital of Foshan City.CT examination and expert consultation were diagnosed as confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia.According to previous reports, the diagnostic case of the asymptomatic infection of No. 1 was Liang Moumou, and he and the asymptomatic infected with No. 2 were a couple.They and her 1 -year -old daughter and 56 -year -old mother, Chen Moumou, lived in Huafu Royal River River Shore, Guicheng Street, Nanhai District, Foshan.On May 28, Chen Moumou and his son were diagnosed with asymptomatic infections together, and the granddaughter of the year and one month was diagnosed as a confirmed case.On May 30, Chen Moumou turned into a confirmed case.On June 1, Liang Moumou also turned into a confirmed case, and a family of three generations became a confirmed case.The case of non -symptomatic infection in No. 3 is also related to this family.She is a close contact with Chen Moumou 56.

What is going on?Reporter | Editor in Zheng Jie | Xie Xin late at night on June 6, a new report of new crown pneumonia in Longgang District, Shenzhen.The patient\\'s surname is Luo. He is 45 years old. He lives in Xikeng Village, Xikeng, Longgang District. He is a worker in Yantian Port. Luo is a close contact with the \"5.21\" epidemic case.It is noticeable that during the concentrated isolation from May 21 to June 1 before confirming the new crown pneumonia, Luo accepted a total of 11 nucleic acid testing, and the results of 11 nucleic acid tests were negative.Until June 5, Luo Mounucleic acid testing was positive, and positive was reviewed at the Shenzhen Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on June 6.After the diagnosis is a confirmed case of new crown pneumonia, Luo has now transferred to the emergency hospital of Shenzhen Third People\\'s Hospital for treatment.Fortunately, Luo Mou had been included in the centralized isolation health observation on May 21 before the diagnosis was confirmed.At present, according to the official report, before the report was positive, Luo did not leave the Xikeng community, and after 14 days of centralized isolation observation, he has been in home health monitoring.However, the first 11 nucleic acid testing of the diagnosis shows that the rare phenomenon of negatives still trigger a lot of discussions. In fact, nucleic acids have repeatedly diagnosed new crown pneumonia after nucleic acid testing negative.At the press conference of the Dalian New Crown Pneumonia Epidemia in early January this year, the relevant person in charge introduced that the positive condition was detected after 11 nucleic acid testing.On January 16th, Cai Wei, member of the Standing Committee of the Shunyi District Committee and executive deputy head of the Beijing Municipal Committee of Beijing, introduced that a female case appeared positive during the test of the 7th nucleic acid test and was diagnosed that day.In medical, this situation is called fake negative, that is, the detected person has infected the new coronal virus, but the virus nucleic acid is not detected.The detection of the new coronary virus nucleic acid uses the method of reverse transcription-polystonase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Theoretically, the sensitivity of this detection method is very high.According to the previous occurrence of nucleic acid detection of false negatives, there are mainly the following reasons for false negatives.The first is that the content of the new crown virus nucleic acid in the original test specimen is too low, which is lower than the lower limit that can be detected.The virus load is small and so on.Jiang Rongmeng, deputy dean of Beijing Diquan Hospital and director of the National Infectious Disease Quality Control Center, previously introduced that in actual operation, sampling quality, infection time, specimen type, detection reagent, etc. will affect the results of the nucleic acid testing, as if the lower respiratory tract specimen is positiveThe rate is significantly higher than the upper respiratory specimen.If it is a mixed examination, there is a situation where the virus volume is further diluted, which theoretically increases the difficulty of detection.If the part of the new coronary virus nucleic acid and the probe is mutated, it may affect the binding efficiency of the probe during the detection, resulting in not detection of fluorescent signals.At the same time, false negatives are also related to the sensitivity of detection technology.For example, in the early stage of the epidemic, the kits used in clinicals were not mature enough and the sensitivity was not high enough.Later, the level of technology increased, the accuracy of detection increased rapidly, and the false negative rate continued to decrease.In addition, the analysis process of the new crown nucleic acid detection back -end detection service will also affect the final result.From the original point of view of nucleic acid detection, a specific virus is the target of a specific virus. Due to PCR amplification, the nucleic acid increases the target DNA sequence index level.The result is to determine whether there is a virus nucleic acid in the specimen by detecting the accumulation of fluorescent signals.疫情发展到现阶段，新冠病毒核酸检测技术已经较为成熟，罗某作为深圳本轮疫情的密接者，理论上会采取1：1单人单管采样，而非按照1：10混采，而从From May 21st to June 5th, there is a long time in the middle. Why are there fake negative results for more than 10 days?The details need to be further reported to the official, but in addition to the detection of nucleic acid, the diagnosis of new crown pneumonia also needs to combine the history of epidemiology, clinical performance, and image performance.In addition, interface journalists inquired about the official website of the People\\'s Government of the Longgang District of Shenzhen, and found that according to April 12, 2021, the new crown virus purchased by the new crown virus purchased by the Disease Prevention and Control Center of the Disease Prevention and Control Center of the Disease Prevention and Control Center of the Longgang District in Shenzhen, ShenzhenNucleic acid testing is Shenzhen Nuclear Huaxi Medical Inspection Lab and Shenzhen Heplos Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Heiplos Medical Inspection Laboratory).According to the \"Guangdong Provincial Health and Health Commission Guangdong Provincial Drug Administration of Health and Health Commission, the Guangdong Provincial Drug Administration issued by the Guangdong Provincial Medical Security Bureau on May 17\"\" Notice \", the selected reagent testing companies mainly include Daian, Shengxiang Biology, Zhijiang Biology, Mingde Biology, Dian Biological, Jinhao Pharmaceutical, Berje Medical and other companies.According to the publicity content, the total procurement of the procurement detection reagent was more than 40 million copies.At present, the high incidence area of \\u200b\\u200bthe Shenzhen -Shenzhen epidemic is concentrated in Longgang District and Yantian District, including 9 cases of Yantian report and 7 cases of Longgang reported.Although the entire Shenzhen City has not yet officially announced the testing of nucleic acid testing in the city, Futian District, the city center, has been detected on June 6.The anti -control measures for the Shenzhen epidemic situation are also strengthened.

At 7 o\\'clock on September 10, the two students in the school were found to be brothers.

After 14 days of centralized isolation at Xiamen, it was transferred to the centralized isolation point of Xianyou County on August 19th.According to the prevention and control of the epidemic in Fujian Province, Lin Moujie started 7 days of home health monitoring on August 26 after completing a centralized isolation of 14+7 days.The official report also said that during the concentrated isolation 21 days after the entry, Lin Moujie conducted 9 nucleic acid tests and 1 serum testing.

As a result, it was initially determined to be Delta strains.Regarding the \"long incubation period\" showed by Delta\\'s strains in this round of epidemic, Peng Zhiyong, Director of the Institute of Severe Medicine, Central South Hospital of Wuhan University, said in an interview with the Global Times reporter on the 11th that according to previous observations, setting in setting, setting setting at the setting, settled in setting, set up at the set.During the concentrated isolation observation period, about 95%~ 99%of infected people can be detected, but they cannot avoid individual extreme conditions.\"The public does not have to worry about the\" ultra -long incubation period \"of Delta\\'s strain infection, because the general features of Delta\\'s strains are currently showing a strong infectious power, and the other is the high virus capacity.The high virus load is actually easy to screen. At present, it seems that Delta\\'s strain is actually more likely to be discovered than the previous strains. \"Peng Zhiyong said.At the same time, Peng Zhiyong also said that the epidemic in the epidemic and the epidemic in Guangzhou, Yangzhou and other places showed the importance of strengthening vaccination.Peng Zhiyong said that although the number of infections in the recent rounds of epidemics, there are few patients with critical condition.

The cluster was detected thanks to routine testing in local schools, where two students tested positive on Friday. Their father, who returned from Singapore in early August, was also found to have been infected. Officials believe he is the likely source of the latest outbreak in the region, a manufacturing hub for sneakers, clothing and electronic components, which now stretches to more than 60 people in three cities. The man did three weeks of quarantine and took 10 tests with no signs of infection before returning to the community, underscoring how difficult it can be to identify every case. China’s so-called Covid Zero policy relies on aggressive testing and contact tracing to quickly spot and isolate the pathogen anytime it penetrates the world’s second-largest economy. The virus quickly took off in Fujian’s schools and factories. At least 19 of the infected people are under the age of 12, a group that China’s blistering vaccination campaign has yet to reach. The country’s top health regulator sent a task force over the weekend to the city of Putian, where most of the cases have been found thus far. Other patients were detected in the port cities of Quanzhou and Xiamen. The latest wave comes less than a month after China contained its broadest outbreak since the virus’s initial emergence in Wuhan, with escalating curbs that included regional lockdowns and train and flight suspensions. The effort returned China to its vaunted Covid Zero status, but it disrupted the recovery of the world’s second largest economy over the summer. Similar curbs could ensue if the current outbreak spreads beyond Fujian. Such a move could threaten tourism and consumption during the upcoming seven-day National Day Holiday starting October 1. Delta’s incursions throw into question the sustainability of the Covid Zero strategy that China has pursued throughout the pandemic. Other countries in the Asia-Pacific region that sought to eliminate the virus have gradually begun adjusting their playbooks to accept it as an endemic, a move intended to minimize social and economic disruptions that stem from aggressively containing Covid. Singapore has started to unwind some restrictions now that more than 80% of it residents are vaccinated, while Australia will move to ease curbs in New South Wales, its most populous state, once more than 70% of its eligible population is fully vaccinated. Both places are currently facing outbreaks. While China’s vaccination drive has seen around 70% of its population immunized, Beijing has made it clear that it will continue to rely on monitoring and infection control curbs since it believes mass vaccination alone will be insufficient to contain the delta variant. China has relied on a raft of homegrown vaccines, mostly inactivated shots, with little conclusive evidence on how effective they are against the more transmissible variant. Although mass testing and movement restrictions have been put in place in Fujian, the virus still is expected to spread, according to a report from Health Time, a newspaper affiliated with state-backed People’s Daily, that cited outbreak modeling by epidemiologist Huang Senzhong of Tianjin’s Nankai University. As many as 500 people may eventually become infected, and the virus could spread to other places in China later this week. It should be under control in early October, the report said, citing Huang. About 30,000 people left Putian, the epicenter of the outbreak, between Aug. 26 and Sept. 10, according to a report from state broadcaster CCTV. The city has notified several provinces to screen for potential infections among travelers, it said.

It is getting more and more unable to go. Seeing it to coexist with humans. If our strategy destroys the virus like SARSOn a long -term war, he said.Since the beginning of this year, the Chinese government has vigorously promoted vaccination.Official data shows that the cumulative vaccination of China has exceeded 2 billion doses, and nearly 890 million people have completed the whole process, which is equivalent to more than 6 adults across the country.In order to cope with the recent epidemic situation, the authorities have also accelerated the vaccination and strengthening needle injection.

from two chains of infection, starting from the Northern Mongolia Autonomous Region and Heilong Jiang Province in the Northeast.The new epidemic has begun spread in China in mid -October when some

infection in China is much lower than other countries around the world, but China still tightens the harsh anti -epidemic measures under the Zero Covid strategy (no covid), including the border closing,blockade, isolation and mass testing.However, this strategy has been controversial so far.The city government of Thanh Do on November 10 said that 30,000 CIVI-19 tests were conducted at a large entertainment center, all of them had negative results.Earlier, Disneyland amusement park in Shanghai in October also tested more than 30,000 people, keeping visitors staying until nearly

of the expected event on November 28.At the end of October, marathon competitions in Wuhan, Thach Gia Trang and Beijing were also postponed to prevent the risk of outbreak.China accelerated epidemic control in the context of an important party conference this week in Beijing.The capital of China is also the place to host the Winter Olympics in February next year.The fact that athletes and

Authorities reported 162 new community infections on Monday, up from 158 on Sunday. All but 10 of Monday’s new cases were reported in Shaanxi province, where 13 million residents of the capital Xi’an have been forced to stay in their homes for five days. The lockdown is the first time China had implemented such severe measures since 2020, as authorities continue to doggedly pursue a “zero Covid” approach to stamp out all local infections ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February. Since the coronavirus first emerged in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, China has largely kept the pandemic at bay with tight border restrictions, lengthy quarantines and targeted lockdowns. It has officially recorded only two deaths in over a year. While low by international standards, the new case number marks the highest count of local symptomatic infections since March 2020, when the daily bulletin provided by the National Health Commission started to classify asymptomatic carriers separately. On Saturday, the country recorded the highest daily rise in local cases in 21 months as infections more than doubled in Xi’an. In total there have been 635 confirmed coronavirus cases during the 9 to 26 December period. A fourth round of mandatory testing day was under way in Xi’an – home to the world-famous Terracotta Warriors - as hundreds of health workers were deployed to detect new infections in a bid to stamp out virus spread. The city, a two hour flight southwest of Beijing, also launched a disinfection campaign, with staffers spraying pathogen-killing solutions on surfaces of roads and buildings. Residents are advised not to touch plants after the disinfection. About 3,000 stations were set up to carry out testing on all residents, according to state media. More than 45,000 medical volunteers have also joined efforts to curb the spread of the virus, according to the Shaanxi provincial government. Authorities were investigating 17,527 residents who have been identified as close contacts, while 41,671 people are serving mandatory hotel quarantine. State media reported medical staff at testing centres suffered from swollen hands after conducting hundreds of tests in the cold. The main causes of the rise in numbers were more cases being detected during mandatory testing, and the spread of new clusters in more districts, Zhang Yi, Director of the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Institute of the Shaanxi Provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Sunday. Authorities have deployed one security personnel for every 10 residents in 283 allocated “closed areas” in the city, where a “door-to-door” service is provided and no residents are allowed to leave their homes. Only one person from each household in another 229 “controlled areas” is allowed to leave their homes every other day for two hours to buy daily necessities, according to regulations issued by Shaanxi authorities. Authorities imposed a snap lockdown on Xi’an’s residents on Thursday, suspending means of transport to and from the city except for emergencies requiring official approval and mostly confining residents to their homes. The rising numbers triggered some parts of the city to implement even tighter restrictions on residents on Monday. Residents at the Xi’an National Hi-tech Industries Development Zone from Monday morning were only allowed to leave their homes to undergo mandatory testing or receive medical treatment, with only one designated member of the family being allowed to buy necessities once every three days, according to local media.

The National Health Commission reported on Saturday 175 new community infections with confirmed clinical symptoms for December 31, bringing the total number of local symptomatic cases in mainland China in the past week to 1,151. The surge has been driven mostly by an outbreak in the northwestern industrial and tech hub of Xian, a city of 13 million. The deepening outbreak in Xian will likely firm authorities\\' resolve to curb transmissions quicklyas and when cases emerge. The city, under lockdown for 10 days as of Saturday, has reported 1,451 local symptomatic cases since Dec. 9, the highest tally for any Chinese city in 2021. While China\\'s case count is tiny compared to many outbreaks elsewhere in the world, forestalling major flare-ups in 2022 will be important. Beijing will be hosting the Winter Olympic Games in February, and the ruling Communist Party will hold a once-every-five-years congress, expected in the fall, where President Xi Jinping will likely secure a third term as party secretary. The emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant will also drive Beijing to stick to its high vigilance against the virus. China has reported a handful of imported Omicron cases and at least one locally transmitted case. Since August, China has tried to get any outbreak under control within about two weeks, much shorter than the four to six weeks in earlier battles against sporadic flare-ups following the initial nationwide epidemic, according to the National Health Commission. Cities along China\\'s borders are at higher virus risk, either due to the presence of overland transport links or entry of infected travellers from other countries. Some were hit by Delta outbreaks that resulted in harsh travel curbs last year. Yunnan, which shares a border with Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, reported new local symptomatic cases on 92 out of 365 days last year, or 25% of the time, more often than any other province, autonomous region or municipality.

Many people have been forbidden from leaving their residential compounds, but a city government official said on Friday curbs would be loosened in less risky compounds when the time was right. Postgraduate student Li Jiaxin, 23, said nobody can leave the campus of her university. She spent New Year\\'s Eve with her three room mates and was unable to meet with her boyfriend and family. \"I may be what you would consider a person with a strong sense of ritual, so I still feel a little sad that we are not together at this time,\" she said.

Although there are fewer cases compared to the one million people daily in the United States, there are fewer cases of cases.However, under China\\'s \"clearing zero\" policy, some cities are closed in the city, and people are facing inconvenience or trouble.According to information disclosed by the local government, among the 20 infected people currently found in Tianjin, they include a number of students and parents of students, and the trajectory involves custody classes and many schools.One of the earliest discovered cases was a 29 -year -old staff of Toto Auxiliary, and the other was a 10 -year -old elementary school student.Image source, Getty Images, of the 18 people detected from their dense people on the same day, 8 students were 9 years old or 10 years old at the age of 9 or 10;11 years old; the two are students in Xinzhuang Middle School, who are 12 years old or 13 years old; the remaining 4 people have the family members of the above -mentioned students.It is worth mentioning that on January 8th, 4 students in the confirmed cases of Zhengzhou City and Xuchang City, Henan Province, from the 47th Middle School Student, Liangbei Central School, and Yuzhou Bilingual Experimental School West CampusEssenceIn addition, there is a student in Luoyang diagnosed patients.Different from Henan and Shaanxi, through the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two of the earliest local cases discovered in Tianjin were infected with Omikon mutant strains, including 18 cases discovered later, all of which belonged to the same spread chain.However, the above -mentioned cases are not confirmed to be the same propaganda chain as the Omiqon mutant strain sequences found abroad in Tianjin.This means that the specific source of local cases discovered in Tianjin is still unknown.Zhang Ying, deputy director of the Tianjin Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a press conference on the epidemic prevention and control on January 8 that no initial two cases had the history of living in Jinwai.Through the flow of these two cases, the custody class where adult cases are located, and the primary school where the child is located has a correlation with epidemiology through other cases.According to Zhang Ying, from the perspective of the relationship between cases and the chain of spreading, 18 cases of cases have been spread at least three generations. Although the epidemic was discovered in the early morning of this morning, it may have been spreading in the community for a period of time.Therefore, the authorities announced that starting at 7 o\\'clock on January 9th, the full detection of all members within 24 hours of Tianjin; from 7:00 on January 10, the remaining 12 districts will complete the test of all staff within 24 hours.Before the test was completed, the residents \"kept their place of residence relatively static at the time.\"When the source of the image, when the new crown epidemic broke out for two years, the extensive spread of the new variant of Omikon made the world not only fail to get out of the epidemic, and the number of diagnosis was even a record.The United States reported a record of 1 million new cases on January 3.Cases of Britain, France, and India are also growing.Facing the threat of Omikon, different countries have different choices -British Prime Minister Johnson said that strict blocking measures will not be implemented in the UK; US President Biden believes that despite the surge in the number of infections, schools should continue to open; France; France; France; France; France; France; France; France;President Macron warned that he intends to make the lives of French people who have not vaccinated the new crown vaccine.China has always adopted the strictest \"clear zero\" measures, but Omikon, who has a stronger communication ability for the first time, appeared in the Chinese community for the first time, and there was a unable to detect community communication chain, which increased the pressure of \"clear zero\".BBC Health and Scientific Affairs Reporter James Gallagher said that if you infected Omikon, your illness is unlikely to be more serious than previous variants.Studies around the world have unanimously showed that Omikjon virus is more milder than virus, which reduces the chance of infected people with 30%to 70%.Omikon can cause cold -level symptoms such as sore throat, runny nose and headache.The source of the image, Reuters is due to this feature that some countries choose to directly bear the impact of Omikon.However, Garrat also said that this does not mean that it is mild to everyone, and some people still suffer from serious illness.Zhang Wenhong, director of the Infectious Department of Huashan Hospital, China Fudan University and Director of the National Infectious Disease Medical Center, recently spoke in a forum that some media said that Omikon caused \"large influenza\", which is a lack of scientific basisIn fact, this mutant plant \"bite people\".A country and region need a strong immune barrier and medical resources to resist the threat of Omikon.Zhang Wenhong said that the reason why Western countries in the \"break through\" are mainly from the vaccine, and their effects need to be further evaluated.He suggested that although the vaccine barrier did not completely prevent the spread of the new coronal virus, it has greatly reduced the toxicity of the virus and reduced the mortality of the infected person.\"You must see that the role of vaccine in the prevention and control of the new crown epidemic cannot be underestimated.\" Tan Desai, Director of WHO Tan Desai, said on January 6, \"Omikon does not seem to be serious.The crowd that has been vaccinated, but this does not mean that it should be mild. \"Tan Dezai added.BBC.

On the 14th, symptoms of sore throat occurred, and the initial sieve of nucleic acid on the 15th.Lin Hansheng, a second -level inspector of the city Health and Health Commission, said that \"it is not ruled out that the epidemic situation is caused by the possibility of infection caused by the new crown virus polluting items exposed to overseas.\" Communication chain, a total of 16 cases of reports.The Shenzhen Health Commission reported earlier that the first case of the communication chain was engaged in the international cargo supply chain.In Zhuhai, health officials said on the 17th that the case of the early epidemic in the city was engaged in a customer service work of an enterprise and often exposed to overseas immigration items. Getty Images needs to note that infection through international mail is still inference, and there is no conclusive evidence to confirm that these cases are caused by contact objects.Jin Dongyan, a professor of biomedicine at the University of Hong Kong, told BBC in Chinese that it is necessary to test whether the live virus can be separated from pollution paper, and confirms 100%homologous of the virus carried by the living virus and the infected person to further confirm the inference.\"If the positive results detected on the paper are only dead viruses, it is not practical for confirming the source of communication,\" Jin Dongyan said.In addition, even if there is a living virus on the paper, it is not possible to determine that the virus is transmitted to the case through paper, because the virus on the paper is currently contaminated by the virus.\"If the diagnostic person is already onset, it may be polluted to paper and objects,\" Jin Dongyan said.Although there is still no evidence, under China\\'s strict \"clear zero\" measures, the Security Supervision and Management Department of the State Post Office has issued a notice on the 16th, saying that \"the anti -control barrier of the international email express epidemic is strictly established, and the overseas epidemic is strictly prevents the transmission of the overseas epidemic. \"Channel input\" image source, many experts in getty Images also said that the probability of spreading the new coronary virus through objects is very low.\"The probability of infection caused by contact surface is one -tenth,\" Jin Dongyan said.He believes that the risks caused by this form of communication are not great.\"Because the amount of virus in contact is very low, it generally only causes mild symptoms or asymptomatic; and it is unlikely to cause clustering infections.\" Jin Dongyan also compared the situation in Hong Kong, saying that the international mail received in Hong Kong may There are many cities, but there are no cases of infection that pass by email.Therefore, for the public, there is no need to worry too much about international mail, and may no longer use international postal services.Just wear a mask and pay attention to hand hygiene when receiving, Jin Dongyan said.The Wall Street Journal quoted Martin Hibberd, a professor of infectious diseases at the School of Health and Tropical Medicine of London, said that although the virus can spread through the surface in a short period of time, such as the door handles that the infected person touched The virus may be transmitted in minutes, but the evidence that spreads through the surface for a long time is small.\"(Passing through the surface of the object) has few evidence, and the 10 -minute window period has passed.

The virus genome of the local local cases was different from previous overseas input cases. It was 100%homologous to the genome uploaded by the global database in North America.Lin Hansheng, a second -level inspector of the Shenzhen Municipal Health and Health Commission, introduced that this case is engaged in the collection and receipt of overseas frozen reagents. He has been in contact and spin -off courier from North America.The possibility.Combined with epidemiological surveys, the traceability of the virus is underway.In addition, Zhuhai reported that according to the current on -site epidemiological survey and laboratory testing, experts judged that the local epidemic did not rule out that it was caused by exposed to polluting entry -imal entry, and further traceability was in progress.How risks are the risk of \"things\"?It is not the main spread of the new crown virus on January 16th, the Security Supervision and Management Department of the State Post Bureau issued a notice, requiring enterprises to do a good job of disinfection and ventilation of international mail express delivery places.After that, the outer packaging was fully covered with all faces for the first time, and a high -risk country and region imported mail expressive emotional epidemic prevention and control disposal plan was formulated.The case where the new crown virus survives for a long time and has been spread through the cold chain at low temperature has reported in some areas of my country in the past year.my country\\'s epidemic prevention and control has always adhered to people, things, and environmental defense.However, sorting out the situation of \"things\" in public reports, it can be found that the infection of the first contact points such as the market and logistics can be found.One of the important reasons is that there are many limited conditions for \"things to pass\", not the main way of spreading the new coronal virus.At the press conference of the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism, Wu Zunyou, chief expert of the Popular disease of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, introduced that \"things\" to cause infection must meet three conditions: one is that the item pollution is heavier;The virus survives for a long time on the surface of the object. Generally speaking, the lower the temperature, the longer the virus survival time; the third is that there are no appropriate protection measures when exposed to pollution items.Wu Zunyou believes that compared with human infection and different virus infection, cases are prone to asymptomatic or mild infections, and often find that it is not timely, which may cause a new epidemic.In the past cases, there were once some foods to detect nucleic acid positive on the surface, which had caused concerns of \"things to person\".To this end, the relevant person in charge of the National Food Safety Risk Evaluation Center stated at the press conference of the State Council ’s joint defense and control mechanism that the findings of live viruses, dead viruses, and viruses may be positive for nucleic acid.Just detecting nucleic acid positive, does not mean infectiousness, can only show that it has been polluted by the new coronary virus.How do I do a good job of protecting?Try to reduce direct contact with overseas courier and control experts to remind that when you charge express delivery, especially overseas express delivery, do a good job of wearing masks, properly handling outer packaging, and use of disinfection of internal parts.Potential risks.Zhang Liubo, chief expert of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that it is best to choose a wayless way to collect express delivery, or try to wear masks and gloves as much as possible.After removing the outer packaging, take off the gloves and clean your hands in time, and do your hand hygiene.Pang Xinghuo suggested that when receiving overseas emails or items, we wear masks and disposable gloves to reduce direct contact and communication.Get parts in a fixed place as much as possible to achieve no contact handover.In addition, try to be performed outdoors when disassembling. You do n’t have to take it home by the outer packaging, and you can treat it according to the domestic waste classification. If you need to take it home, you can use a chlorine disinfection agent or 75%alcohol to completely disinfect the internal and external packaging.After processing the email, take off the gloves in time, change the mask, carefully disinfect or clean your hands, and avoid touching your mouth, eyes, and nose with unclean hands.(Reporter Dong Ruifeng, Song Chen, Wu Wenzheng, Wang Haoming) About us | Foreign Propaganda Service and Advertising Service |\\r\\nIllegal and bad information report Tel: 010-88828271 Reporting Process All rights reserved China Internet News Center Email: News@china.org.cn Tel: 86-10-88828000 Beijing ICP Certificate 0400890105123'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-01-19 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'Beijing The third confirmed case of a locally confirmed person was hit by Delta and Omicron| Cross-Strait - Central News Agency;', 'Translated_Content': \"(Central News Agency Taipei 18th) Beijing official today notified three new local cases, of which one -positive cases were infected with Delta virus variants, and two other confirmed cases were close contact with Omicron variables on the 15th on the 15th.Beijing is also threatened by two COVID-19 virus variants.According to CCTV reports, the Beijing epidemic prevention and control press conference reported today that from 0:00 on the 17th to 3 pm on the 18th, Beijing added 2 newly confirmed cases and 1 case of dot acid testing positive cases.Two cases of confirmed cases, one of which was a mother who notified the OMICRON virus variable in Haidian District in Haidian District on the 15th, and the other was a colleague of the same floor of the unit on the 15th notification case on the 15th.Another nucleic acid detection positive case is living in Chaoyang District.

Source survey.In this regard, Shen Zhengnan, a physician of the Caotun Sanios of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, pointed out on Facebook that the most critical of the Yaxu migrant group is actually a newly added place of migrant footprints?How is the scale?If it is not serious, their dormitory and the company can control the epidemic after general screening.Through the <GOOGLE News> Matching Chi Media Shen Zhengnan, the diffusion trajectory of this wave of OmirCon virus is similar from Taoyuan to Taipei, to Xinbei, and to Yilan. Is it similar to May last year?In May of last year, Taipei, Xinbei and Yilan Qunju all originated from the same spread chain.Someone was shouting that the Omitron virus wanted to clear it.The Delta virus cannot be cleared, and the epidemic will be extended for half a year.Shen Zhengnan explained that the relevant communities of Kaohsiung Qunju were widely carried out in the ship and the port of the port. How many positive cases did they catch?Zero; Taoyuan was inspected more than 2,000 people on the 22nd, which was also zero.This means that there is no obvious virus diffusion, otherwise the positive rate of testing is by no means this.And this is a way to rule out a way to rule out.Shen Zhengnan mentioned that 2 mothers and daughters in the Taoyuan Dazhen market could not find the source of infection so far, but the surrounding contacts were negative, and obviously did not spread.Although there is an unknown source of infection, it is two different things to cause community communication.The Disease Control Department announced the symptoms of the local infected Omircon virus, and the asymptomatic ratio is more than 20 %.Therefore, as long as the community transmission occurs, the spread of the OMICRON virus will automatically appear automatically, so that it will not be transmitted too hard.Shen Zhengnan said that if he exploded to a large group, of course, many people will be diagnosed at once, but after all, it is the storm in the teapot, but the teapot is relatively big.If the Omitron virus is transmitted to a long -term mechanism, it is easy to cause large -scale infection, but it is another matter if the virus can be passed to the institution.In the same way, Yaxu\\'s migration group gathers, more than 30 new cases can also be viewed on the 23rd.The most important thing now is where the migrant footprint is passed. Is there a new increase?How is the scale?If it is not serious, their dormitory and the company can control the epidemic after general screening.Shen Zhengnan mentioned that there are thousands of community screening in Hsinchu County in the past two days, and it is also a zero diagnosis.Does it include those contacters of Hengshan Tucheng City?If so, there is still a certain toughness of epidemic prevention in the restaurant.The new case of Kaohsiung has found the source of infection. The cases of Taipei and Yilan have the opportunity to find the upstream contactors.After the Kaohsiung Cluster and Taoyuan Migration Group are cleaned up, the new will decline.A small amount of virus leakage will still happen. It is possible to gather from overseas or from the existing community groups, but as long as you do not blow up a complex cluster, it is still controllable.Shen Zhengnan pointed out that the geographical diffusion of the epidemic in May last year was the trajectory from Luzhou Wanhua to Shuangbei, to Yilan, and then spreading to the central and southern parts, from near to far, showing a gradual distribution.The same is true of the Omitron virus. If the epidemic is passed from the north to the south, it will definitely leave a trajectory in the central part, otherwise it is a cluster of different sources.Shen Zhengnan analyzed that the first case of Taoji cleaner was just one month, and it has accumulated more than 200 cases throughout Taiwan. However, in mid -May last year, thousands of cases have been reported. The difference is that this time was very early.The valuable experience left in the epidemic in May last year is the popular sieve and accurate epidemic. The former can evaluate the severity of the community transmission, and the latter can ensure that the virus is blocked.See more [New Crown pneumonia epidemic] Latest report: https://bit.ly/3AAQ9D6 Recently three reports like this article?Please comprehensively report to the wind media to drink a cup of coffee and tell me that this article is awesome!Relevant reports today selected the most people sponsoring this week.

According to a period of time, the actual judgment of the actual living in the prevention area has been made.There is a channel for appeal on the health code. If you leave this community before January 19, you can directly turn to the green code.If you leave before January 26th, you need to provide a nucleic acid detection certificate within 48 hours to turn into a green code.The second one also reports that he has become orange codes in the periphery of the prevention and control zone.These situations can also appeal on the health code platform, which will be handled quickly.Reporter Li Weihe'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-01-30 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'On January 29, Tianjin added 4 new cases of COVID-19 virus positive infection;', 'Translated_Content': 'On January 29, Tianjin added 4 cases of new crown virus -positive infections.Among them, 3 cases were added to Hebei District.The first case lives in Red Posali, Jianchang Road Street, Hebei District.

Warm reminder of the China Disease Control and Control Center: It is still in the global epidemic period of new coronary virus pneumonia. When enjoying the joyful and peaceful Spring Festival, it also needs to prevent the new crown epidemic at the same time. Prevent and control people infection with bird flu, seasonal influenza, norvi virus infection, food poisoning and carbon monoxide poisoning.Focusing on the characteristics of related risks and specific prevention measures 4 Nuo Ru Ru Viral gastroenteritis Winter and spring is the high hair season for virus gastroenteritis. The crowd is generally susceptible.The characteristics of low infectious dosage, short latency period, long detoxification time and other characteristics can easily cause spread among the crowd.Collective places such as schools and childcare institutions are the high incidence of virus gastrointestinal epidemic/clustered epidemic.Travel groups, cruise ships, and vacations also often have a virus epidemic.Norru virus spread includes people, food and water transmission.People are transmitted through dung-oral channels, including ingrains that occur during vomiting, vomit or feces that are exposed to patients, and the surface of environmental objects contaminated with feces or vomit pollution.Food -based communication is spread by eating food contaminated by viruses. The pollution session can appear in catering practitioners infected with the virus infection.During the process, it is contaminated by the excrement or other substances (such as water, etc.) containing a virus.Drinking water, water supply, well water such as barrel water, municipal water supply, and well water can be transmitted through water.The most common clinical symptoms are vomiting and diarrhea, followed by nausea, abdominal pain, headache, fever, chills, and muscle soreness. Most patients with symptoms continue to recover after 2 to 3 days.Few cases can cause severe illnesses or even death.The main preventive measures maintain good personal hygiene, especially hand hygiene.Good personal hygiene is the most important and effective measure to prevent virus infection and spread.Washing your hands frequently, especially when you go home and go home, take care of the patient before meals, prepare or distribute food and meals, and wash your hands correctly according to 7 steps. Use soap and flowing water for at least 20 seconds.Pay attention to diet and water hygiene.Select restaurants with regular and good sanitary conditions for meals. Try to eat cooked food as much as possible. Wash raw and fruits, oysters and other shellfish products must be cooked before eating; do not drink raw water.Self -active isolation of cases.Nuo Ru Viral infection is the best home to be separated from the disease to 3 days after recovery. Try not to contact other healthy family members at close range, especially do not prepare and process food or take care of the elderly and infants.Pollutants have timely disinfection and cleaning.The surface of vomit or feces contaminated by patients should be cleaned and disinfected with chlorine bleach or other effective disinfection agents in time, and immediately removes and washed out of polluting clothing or sheets.Wash your hands carefully after cleaning.5 During the holidays of food poisoning, there are increased personnel flow, the chances of dining and dining in foreign countries increase, and the risk of food poisoning incidents increases.Mainland my country is most common in food poisoning caused by microorganisms. It mainly occurs in dietary service units and collective cafeterias. It is manifested by eating the same or more contaminated or deterioration foods together. , Vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms.The main preventive measures are kept clean. Before meal, the treatment of raw, cooked food and their packaging, contacting pets, and processing of garbage should be washed hard.Tableware and kitchen utensils should be washed and dried with flowing safe water, and disinfection is often cooked. The kitchen environment should be cleaned.Raw cooked foods should be separated, and kitchen utensils and containers that processed food should be separated.Food should be cooked thoroughly, and the remaining food and overnight food should be completely heated.Save food at a safe temperature, and the cooked food should not be stored for more than 2 hours at room temperature. The food that cannot be eaten in time should be refrigerated or freezes. The cooking food should be kept above 60 ° C before eating.Do not buy or eat foods that exceed the shelf life.Use safe water and food ingredients, choose fresh vegetables and fruits, and do not have mildew main grains, beans and peanuts, etc., properly clean, peel and reduce risks; the entire process of food production should be used for safe water.Dining units with good food hygiene, high reputation, and complete licenses should be selected for meals to maintain a good way of dining. Try to choose a meal method, and promote the use of public chopsticks and spoons to reduce the risk of cross -pollution.6 Carbon monoxide poisoning carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless and irritating choking gas.In my country, the season when non -professional carbon dioxide poisoning is consistent with the coal -fired heating season in northern my country.High -incidence provinces are mainly distributed in northeast, North and East China in my country.The main places for non -professional carbon monoxide poisoning are families, including rooms with heating equipment such as coal stoves and charcoal fires, toilets or shower rooms of gas, gas water heaters, and kitchens with gas and gas cookers.In addition, the garage, basement, and closed air -conditioning cars using small oil and steam motors are also high -risk places.The clinical symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are mainly related to the concentration of carbon oxygen protein in the body\\'s blood.After mild and moderate poisoning, it is quickly separated from the poisoning environment and rescued in time. Generally, there are no symptoms.Patients with severe poisoning have a high mortality rate, and survivors may have severe sequelae.The main preventive measures should be selected as possible to concentrate heating as possible in the cold season.When using gas, gas stoves or small oils, and steam motors in the home, it should maintain a good ventilation state. It is best to install a carbon monoxide detector and check and maintain regularly.Once non -professional carbon dioxide poisoning occurs, the window should be opened immediately, and the poisoners should be quickly transferred to fresh air and good ventilation.Dial the 120 emergency call as soon as possible to treat high -pressure oxygen tank as soon as possible; for critical patients who have stopped breathing and stopping heartbeat, they should immediately give artificial respiration and heart compressor.优 The \"Excellent Surging Government Number\" in 2021 was announced, and Handan released the list!

Get features like China reported its highest daily tally of coronavirus infections since the Wuhan outbreak at the start of the pandemic, as the highly transmissible omicron variant sparks multiple clusters across the country. Hong Kong added 31,008 Covid cases and 153 deaths Sunday. Although reported infection counts were less than 40,000 for the second straight day, after rising to more than 50,000 in the three days prior, officials said the decline could be due to unreported rapid testing results and because of the “weekend effect.” The global death toll from Covid-19 neared 6 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. Key Developments: China Adds Most Cases Since Wuhan Outbreak (9:32 a.m. HK) China reported its highest daily tally of coronavirus infections since the Wuhan outbreak at the start of the pandemic, as the highly transmissible omicron variant sparks multiple clusters across the country. The nation announced 214 domestic confirmed cases -- defined as people who are symptomatic -- and 312 asymptomatic infections on Monday. The 526 total for a single day is a level that hasn’t been seen in two years and poses a significant challenge to the country’s steadfast adherence to a Covid Zero strategy. The Covid Zero policy has increasingly isolated the world’s most populous country from the rest of the world as western nations pivoted to living with the virus and gradually opening up. Managers Expect Cut in Flexible Work (8:01 a.m. HK) More than half of U.K. managers expect to dial back their pandemic-era embrace of remote work and flexible arrangements once Covid-19 recedes, dampening hopes among employees that many of the changes will endure. Some 34% managers and HR professionals believe that remote working initiatives will be rolled back after the pandemic, a survey of more than 750 people showed, even though 66% support current policies. Global Death Toll Nears 6 Million (5 p.m. NY) A count of worldwide deaths from Covid-19 is nearing 6 million, though the actual number is much higher and unknowable as infections concentrate in Asian nations less affected by earlier viral waves. Total global deaths recorded were at 5,998,428, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. Each of the last million deaths has been punctuated by coronavirus variants -- first delta, then omicron. US Trucker Convoy Circles D.C. (4:44 p.m. NY) A group of truckers calling themselves the Freedom Convoy made two noisy laps around the Washington Beltway, a highway that circles the city, to protest vaccination mandates and restrictions adopted to battle the pandemic. The trucks, many of them festooned with American flags, honked their horns whenever they saw supporters waving at them from overpasses or other vehicles. Rigs in the convoy made most of the journey traveling in the middle lane and slightly under the posted speed limit, according to a report from radio station WTOP. It took between 30 and 35 minutes for it to pass. The People’s Convoy describes itself as law abiding citizens, according to its website. They call for an end to the state of emergency that’s led to the imposition of vaccine mandates by some governments and want congressional hearings to examine the response to the pandemic. After circuiting the highway twice -- a journey that’s a little less than 130 miles -- most of the trucks headed back north to Hagerstown, Maryland, where they originally assembled Friday. It’s not clear what their next move is, though they have stated they have no intention to attempt to shut down Washington in the same way Canadian truckers blockaded Ottawa for three weeks in February. Covid Reality Arrives for New Zealand (12 a.m. HK) After keeping the virus at bay for so long, Covid-19 is now tearing through the nation’s population courtesy of the highly infectious omicron variant. In the space of two weeks, new case numbers exploded from less than 1,000 a day to more than 22,000. Two years after the pandemic began, New Zealanders are finally facing its reality. Hong Kong Seeks Help of Private Hospitals (6 p.m. HK) Hong Kong authorities are liaising with private hospitals to make space for Covid patients as the city battles its worst wave yet of the virus. The government is sending more government hospital patients who are being treated for ailments other than Covid-19 to private facilities if they are in a stable condition and in recovery, to free up beds in the public system, health officials said at a press briefing Sunday. “We will continue to be in touch with private hospitals to reduce pressure on public hospitals,” said Larry Lee, chief manager of the Hospital Authority. The city’s health system and morgues are under the pressure from a record outbreak that’s pushed its death rate to one of the highest in the world.'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-03-07 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'China seeing new surge in COVID-19 cases despite ‘zero tolerance’', 'Translated_Content': 'BEIJING\\xa0—\\xa0 China is seeing a new surge in COVID-19 cases across the vast country, despite its draconian “zero tolerance” approach to dealing with outbreaks.  The mainland Monday reported 214 new cases of infection over the previous 24 hours, with the most, 69, in the southern province of Guangdong bordering Hong Kong, which has been recording tens of thousands of cases per day.  An additional 54 cases were reported in the Jilin province, more than 1,200 miles to the north, and 46 in the eastern province Shandong.  In his annual report to the national legislature Saturday, Premier Li Keqiang said China needs to “constantly refine epidemic containment” but gave no indication Beijing might ease the highly touted “zero tolerance” strategy.  Li called for accelerating vaccine development and “strengthening epidemic controls” in cities where travelers and goods arrive from abroad.  “Zero tolerance” requires quarantines and lockdowns on entire communities and sometimes even cities when as few as a handful of cases have been detected.

Why do more than 2,000 new infections in a single day surge?Zhang Yan, deputy director of the Jilin Provincial Commission of Health and Health, said that the number of infected people in the province\\'s diagnosis report increased significantly, mainly with two major reasons.On the one hand, it reflects that Omikon\\'s new crown virus is hidden, contagious, and fast transmission. It is difficult to discover early in the early days, and it is easy to form community communication.Jilin City has completed 6 rounds of nucleic acid testing, Jiu Tai District of Changchun City has completed 3 rounds of nucleic acid testing, and 2 rounds of nucleic acid testing has also been completed in other urban areas in Changchun.EssenceOn the other hand, it reflects the rapid rise of the epidemic in individual regions, and the ability to expand medical resources is insufficient, leading to centralized restrictions in the centralized treatment in a short period of time.The emergency response mechanism of individual regions is not sound enough, and the characteristics of the characteristics of Omikon virus and the severe and complex epidemic situation are insufficient understanding, and the research and judgment are not allowed.There is still a gap between interception, dedication, and governance, although \"though\", although there is still a gap.In this regard, according to the changes in the epidemic situation, the provincial party committee and the provincial government decisively decided, and quickly adjusted the leadership teams of the areas of immune -related areas, and strictly implemented various preventive and control measures.2. Why are \"light\"?According to the official release of Jilin, of the 2052 cases of local new coronary pneumonia in Jilin Province, according to the clinical type: 2025 lights and 27 cases of ordinary types.It can be seen that most of them are light cases.In this regard, Zhao Qinglong, director of the Emergency Office of the Jilin Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, pointed out that there are at least three reasons: First, the virus of the epidemic virus in Jilin Province is the BA.2 branch of the Omikon mutant strain, although it is better than OmikdonorThe primitive strain has stronger transmission and faster transmission, but its characteristics determine that the clinical symptoms of the infected people are not obvious or asymptomatic.Second, the vaccination rate of Jilin Province is as high as 95%, and the immunity of the population has increased, which effectively prevents the occurrence of severe cases and death.On the other hand, in areas with low vaccination rates, the infected persons of the Omecko mutant strains are still relatively high.Third, all nucleic acid testing in Jilin Province has conducted a whole nucleic acid test. Some places have been done for five or six rounds. Many confirmed cases were found in the test of the whole nucleic acid test. When the symptoms were mildThe disease is developing towards severe type and hazardous type.Zhao Qinglong said that in response to the current Omikon mutant strains, existing protection measures can still prevent virus spread very effectively as long as it is implemented.In addition, it is necessary to compare time with the virus, and the earlier the case is found, the easier it is to control.3. What are the characteristics of Jilin\\'s epidemic?Zhang Yan, deputy director of the Jilin Province Health and Health Commission, introduced that the epidemic dissemination of Jilin Province was hidden, the virus was contagious, and the transmission speed was fast. Some infected people were contagious after 1 day of infection, and the virus interval was short.The occurrence time of the epidemic is just the beginning of the spring of the spring, and the cross -regional flow of personnel has increased, which further accelerates the spread of the epidemic situation. Some schools have gathered epidemic conditions. The community prevention and control, campus prevention and control situation is severe and complicated, and it is difficult to prevent control.The dinner and markets of the people in rural areas have also accelerated the spread of the epidemic, and a clustered epidemic occurred in some rural areas.4. From the current situation of Jilin Province\\'s epidemic prevention work, how can we carry out prevention and control work strictly?Zhao Qinglong, director of the Emergency Office of the Jilin Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that one is to resolutely overcome the paralysis thoughts, the mood of the war, the chance of luck, and to resolutely curb the rapid development of the epidemic.The second is to expand the scope of nucleic acid screening.At present, the epidemic situation of individual areas is still spreading. Omikon\\'s mutant strains have been dish. It is hidden. It is necessary to carry out multiple rounds of nucleic acid testing in order to find out the epidemic base as soon as possible and quickly cut off the spread chain.The third is to accelerate the investigation and transfer isolation.After discovering the infected person, the three -public (work) coordinated, quickly determine the risk areas and personnel, and the accurate and scientific designated high -risk areas, the seal control management and control areas, and the seal control areas must be \"not out of the house and the service to the door\".The implementation of \"people do not get out of the district, and it is strictly forbidden to gather.\"Trends should be turned around, and they should be separated to completely block community communication and use the shortest time to achieve the clear society.5.

Al Jazeera', 'Translated_Content': 'About 17 million people are placed under lockdown in the wake of worst COVID outbreak in two years. China has placed about 17 million residents under lockdown, as virus cases doubled nationwide to nearly 3,400 and anxiety mounted over the resilience of its ‘zero-Covid’ approach in the face of the worst outbreak in two years. The southern tech hub of Shenzhen – home to about 13 million people – told all residents to stay at home as it struggles to eradicate an Omicron flare-up linked to the neighbouring virus-ravaged city of Hong Kong.     The lockdown and a suspension of public transport will last until March 20, a city government notice said, adding that it would launch three rounds of mass testing. A nationwide surge in cases has seen authorities close schools in Shanghai, China’s biggest city, and lock down northeastern cities, as almost 18 provinces battle clusters of the Omicron and Delta variants. The city of Jilin – centre of the outbreak in the northeast – was partially locked down on Saturday, while residents of Yanji, an urban area of nearly 700,000 bordering North Korea, were confined to their homes on Sunday. China, where the virus was first detected in late 2019, has maintained a strict “zero-COVID” policy, enforced by swift lockdowns, travel restrictions and mass testing when clusters have emerged. But the latest flare-up, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant and a spike in asymptomatic cases, is testing the efficacy of that approach. Zhang Yan, a Jilin health commission official, conceded that the response from local authorities had been lacking. “The emergency response mechanism in some areas is not robust enough,” he said at a press briefing on Sunday. “There is insufficient understanding of the characteristics of the Omicron variant … and judgement has been inaccurate.” Residents of Jilin have completed six rounds of mass testing, with the city reporting more than 2,200 cases of the Omicron variant since Saturday. The neighbouring city of Changchun – an industrial base of nine million people – was locked down on Friday, while at least three other small cities have been locked down since March 1. The mayor of Jilin and the head of the Changchun health commission were dismissed from their jobs on Saturday, state media reported, in a sign of the political imperative placed on local authorities to contain virus clusters. But the strain is showing, with officials increasingly urging softer and more targeted measures to contain the virus, while economists warn tough clampdowns are hurting the economy. Shenzhen residents have been anxious over a renewed outbreak and angst at the swift, draconian measures to squash clusters. “It’s the worst since 2020,” a Shenzhen resident surnamed Zhang told the AFP news agency. “The closures are too sudden. My friend woke up in the morning to find her building was sealed overnight without warning. Her boss had to mail her laptop to her.” The Shenzhen subdistrict of Futian which was locked down on Sunday is home to 300,000 people and a thriving commercial district. It shares a land border crossing with Hong Kong, where the caseload over recent weeks has soared, alarming officials in Beijing. Hong Kong currently has one of the world’s highest death rates from the virus, as the Omicron variant cuts through its elderly population among whom vaccine hesitancy proliferates. In Shanghai, authorities have temporarily locked down individual schools, businesses, restaurants and malls over close-contact fears rather than using mass quarantines. Authorities advised residents not to leave the city unless necessary and tourist attractions started requiring visitors to provide negative COVID tests. “I have friends who I hung out with a few days ago but were suddenly quarantined recently,” Shanghai resident Serena Li told AFP. The government’s approach will “protect citizens”, she said, adding: “In the long run, it’s good.” Long lines were seen outside hospitals on Sunday as people rushed to get tested. “There’s no other way. We definitely have to do what the government has arranged,” said a data analytics worker surnamed Zhang. As cases rise, the country’s National Health Commission announced on Friday that it would make rapid antigen tests available for citizens to buy online or from clinics for “self-testing”. Although nucleic acid tests will continue to be the main method of testing, the move suggests China may be anticipating that official efforts will not be able to contain the virus. Last week, a top Chinese scientist said the country should aim to co-exist with COVID, like other nations where Omicron has spread like wildfire.

TAIPEI, Taiwan â€” Chinese authorities reported 1,337 locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 across dozens of mainland cities Monday as the fast-spreading variant commonly known as \"stealth omicron\" fuels China\\'s biggest outbreak in two years. The vast majority of the new cases were in far northeastern Jilin province with 895. Shenzhen reported 75 new cases as residents began the first of three rounds of mass testing. Officials on Sunday locked down the city, which has 17.5 million people and is a major tech and finance hub that neighbors Hong Kong. The surge on the Chinese mainland is infecting people in cities ranging from Shenzhen to Qingdao on the coast, to Xingtai in the north and the numbers have crept steadily higher since early March. While the numbers are small relative to numbers reported in Europe or in the U.S., or even the city of Hong Kong, which had reported 32,000 cases Sunday, they are the highest since the first big outbreak of COVID-19 in the central city of Wuhan in early 2020. China has seen very few infections since its strict Wuhan lockdown as the government held fast to its zero-tolerance strategy, which is focused on stopping transmission of the coronavirus as fast as possible, by relying on strict lockdowns and mandatory quarantines for anyone who has come into contact with a positive case. The government has indicated it will continue to stick to its strict strategy of stopping transmission for the time being. On Monday, Zhang Wenhong, a prominent infectious disease expert at a hospital affiliated with Shanghai\\'s Fudan University noted in an essay for China\\'s business outlet Caixin, that the numbers for the mainland were still in the beginning stages of an \"exponential rise.\" Shanghai confirmed 41 new cases on Monday. Much of the current outbreak is being driven the variant commonly known as \"stealth omicron,\" or the B.A.2 lineage of the omicron variant, Zhang noted. Early research suggests it spreads faster than the original omicron, which itself spread faster than the original virus and other variants. \"But if our country opens up quickly now, it will cause a large number of infections in people in a short period of time,\" Zhang wrote on Monday. \"No matter how low the death rate is, it will still cause a run on medical resources and a short term shock to social life, causing irreparable harm to families and society.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-03-15 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'China due to COVID-19 infections ...;', 'Translated_Content': 'Translation Error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-03-15 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'China records highest daily infections in Corona since the outbreak of the virus - Arab21', 'Translated_Content': nan}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-03-15 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': \"Covid-19 cases continue to rise in China's worst outbreak since Wuhan - CNN\", 'Translated_Content': \"China reported thousands of new local Covid-19 cases Sunday as the Omicron variant drove the worst outbreak in the country since Wuhan in early 2020, according to the National Health Commission (NHC).\\n     \\n            Health officials said 2,125 cases were reported across 58 cities in 19 of 31 mainland provinces, marking the fourth consecutive day China reported more than 1,000 daily local cases.

The entire Chinese province of Jilin is under lockdown as COVID-19 cases surge across the country. Jilin's daily case counts topped 4,067 on Monday alone, leaving health officials scrambling to catch up to the highly transmissible omicron variant. China is combating the highest level of COVID-19 cases ever, with more than 10,000 cases scattered across 27 provinces and municipalities since the start of this month. China's tried and true method for keeping cases close to zero for more than two years has been to trace, test, and isolate all infections, their close contacts, and the close contacts of those contacts faster than the virus can spread. In the latest surge, however, the highly transmissible omicron variant has moved more quickly than contact tracing allows. The result has been a return to full lockdowns for Jilin's 24 million residents, who are now forbidden to leave as of Monday and are required to shelter at home. In Shanghai and Beijing, all schooling has been moved online indefinitely. Langfang, in Beijing's northern Hebei province, as well as Shenzhen and Dongguan cities, in China's south, are also under lockdown as of Tuesday. Two other cities — Shanghai and Xi'an — have put in place some lockdown measures. China has contained omicron outbreaks before, but none has grown as big as the current surge. The strain is already showing as cities are running out of isolation facilities to put tens of thousands of close contacts. Nearby, Hong Kong serves as a warning of the cost of failure. The city is still logging more than 26,000 new cases a day and is suffering the world's highest COVID-19 fatality rate.

Beijing: China’s health authorities reported two COVID-19 deaths on Saturday, the first since January 2021, as the country battles its worst outbreak in two years driven by a surge in the highly transmissible Omicron variant. The deaths, both in north-eastern Jilin province, bring the country’s coronavirus death toll to 4638. Health workers wearing protective suits store COVID-19 test samples at a hotel used for COVID quarantine on March 20 in the Yanqing district of Beijing. Credit: AP Both fatalities occurred in elderly patients and were the result of their underlying conditions, Jiao Yahui, an official with the National Health Commission, told a news briefing on Saturday. One of them had not been vaccinated for COVID-19, she said. The majority of new 2157 community transmissions reported on Saturday came from Jilin. The province has imposed a travel ban, with people needing permission from police to travel across borders. Nationwide, China has reported more than 29,000 confirmed cases since the beginning of March. It has pressed on with its tried-and-true policy of lockdowns and mass testing of millions of people as part of a successful, if burdensome, “zero-COVID” strategy since the initial outbreak in Wuhan in 2019. The country has seen relatively few infections from the virus so far because clusters are tamped down as quickly as they’re discovered. The strategy has received popular support and prevented the large numbers of deaths seen in other countries, many of which have started to forgo any kind of social distancing measures. Faced with the worst surge since late 2019, officials have vowed to double down on the zero-tolerance strategy to contain multiple outbreaks across China. However, leader Xi Jinping acknowledged for the first time the burden of the measures on Thursday, saying that China should seek “maximum effect” with “minimum cost” in controlling the virus. Hong Kong’s leader said on Sunday that her government would consider lifting strict social distancing measures as new COVID-19 infections in the city continued trending downward. “I wouldn’t promise now that there’s room for adjustment,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said. “But following a review, we have a duty to account for the findings in this review and the direction we will take.” Hong Kong is in the middle of a massive outbreak, recording over 1 million total cases in the city of 7.4 million. The city has been hit hard, with mortuaries full as they try to cope with a high number of deaths. Hong Kong has so far refrained from a strict city-wide lockdown like those that China regularly imposes to control the spread of the virus. But new infections in the city have been declining. In early March, Hong Kong reported more than 50,000 new infections in one day. On Saturday, it recorded 16,583 new cases. “Having gone through the peak that you have seen here ... I think a responsible government should regularly and vigorously review these measures, to see whether there is room for adjustment,” Lam said. Lam said she would present the findings on Monday. Mainland China’s COVID-19 data is counted separately from Hong Kong, a special administrative region.

Among them, the cumulative cases of Jilin Province have reached 11,000 cases since early March.Toyota and the public were forced to suspend local production lines.In this regard, observers said that this wave of epidemic not only shows that the zero -zero -zero policy of China\\'s epidemic prevention is difficult to curb the spread of virus, but the car supply chain is also likely to be broken, which is more likely to further damage and the political reputation of the CCP Xi Jinping.No media available resources China is facing the worst wave of new crown epidemic since 2020. The highly contagious Omikdonovirus has spread in more than 20 provinces and regions and cities across the country. Local cases have accumulated more than on February 10th.20,000 cases, mainly concentrated in Jilin Province, Guangdong Province, Shanghai and other places.\\n\\nAmong them, Jilin Province, which has a severe epidemic area, has not only exceeded thousands of new cases since March since mid -March, and two local deaths have occurred on March 19th. This is China. This is China.The number of cases rose for the first time.However, the National Health and Health Commission of China stated that the cause of the death of the two patients was the basic disease.\\n\\nIn order to strictly control the epidemic, the Vice Premier of the State Council Sun Chunlan went to Jilin Province to guide the epidemic prevention work from March 13th to 16th from March 13th to 16th, and instructed the use of nucleic acid and antigen detection to improve the detection ability.Jilin Province was announced on March 14, making the province\\'s life of about 24 million people pressed the suspension button.\\n\\nHan Jun, governor of Jilin Province, vowed to do a good job in the screening of all nucleic acid screening, full treatment of positive patients in Jilin City, and full -grade isolation of the staff of the secrets, and in one week to achieve \"zero society\".From March 21, Jilin City, with a population of nearly 4 million, has implemented a four -day static management of the whole region. Persons from the sealing and controlled areas are strictly prohibited from leaving the house.Out of it, and residents can only purchase living materials online every 2-3 days, send them to the door, disinfect themselves and take them away.\\n\\nHowever, the epidemic in Jilin Province has not been eased so far.There are still nearly 1200 new cases on March 19.Zhang Li, deputy director of the Jilin Provincial Health and Health Commission, admits at a press conference at the epidemic prevention press conference on Friday (March 18) that the current epidemic is severe and complicated. Among them, the epidemic in Changchun and Jilin City is the most serious, and its infection accounts for more than 98%of the province.\\n\\nJilin epidemic scholar: Epidemic prevention and \"clearing\" in the week of the \"Beijing Spring\" editor -in -chief of \"Beijing Spring\" in New York, USA believes that although the Chinese authorities strongly curb virus raging, Jilin Province will reach a \"social clear zero\" within a week.The difficulty is high, and the virus testing method instructed by Sun Chunlan has accuracy and may make the epidemic data distortion.\\n\\nHu Ping told the Voice of America: \"Jilin Province first uses antigen detection for screening. The next step is to review nucleic acid testing, so that the accuracy of the test will be affected because the area of \\u200b\\u200bthe entire epidemic spread is veryGuang, you have adopted a new method, and the credibility of (epidemic) data has become a question.It is still very doubtful at the scheduled time to be clear during the scheduled time.The authorities currently adopted strict measures such as clearing zero and sealing city, which is rising to infringe human rights, and cannot effectively control the epidemic.\\n\\nXie Tian told the Voice of America: \"Other countries in the world are wearing masks, face hoods, or isolation, (maintained) social distance and vaccine.Measures, and adopting the policy of clearing the zero -sealing city, the establishment of a square -cabin hospital has not been really effectively treated. This will not effectively control the epidemic.In fact, it is another evidence of the CCP\\'s ignorance of human rights. \"\\n\\nThe industrial town has fallen into the global automobile industry.\\n\\nSince Jilin is a major automobile industry in China, the local epidemic has severely impacted the automobile manufacturing industry.The Toyota Automobile joint venture between Japan and the German Volkswagen Volkswagen, located in Changchun City, Jilin Province.\\n\\nAccording to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the annual car output of China in 2021 reached about 27 million vehicles, and Jilin Province ranked third in the country with a high output of about 2.43 million.\\n\\nIn this regard, Cai Mingfang, a professor at the Department of Industrial Economics, Tamkang University, located in Taipei, said that global automobile production has long been decreased due to the shortage of chip. Now some automobile factories in Jilin Province have stopped work, which has worsened the automobile industry, and even further impacted the manufacturing and services in ChinaIndustry is more likely to affect the global economy.Cai Mingfang told the Voice of America: \"China (car manufacturer) has stopped working, and the supply chain that the automotive industry has resumed production will be disconnected. If (China) must be cleared, it is not impossible for two or three months (time).Under such circumstances, the influence is from exported manufacturing industries, to the service industry of domestic demand.Influence.\\n\\nXie Tian at the University of South Car also holds a similar view.He said that when China\\'s new crown pneumonia broke out in January 2020, the supply of automotive parts produced in China was short of this, which led to paralysis in the automotive industry in Japan and South Korea.Even the global car supply has a impact.\\n\\nXie Tian said: \"The distribution of the global supply chain has reached such a detailed level. The problems in Jilin this time will have a long effect on the production, manufacturing of global cars, and the used car market.It will last for several months, so this impact will be very great. \"\\n\\nSome production lines moved to Chinese observer because of the Russian and Ukraine War: Beijing may not be profitable\\n\\nIn addition to the influence of the Chinese epidemic and chip shortage, the Russian and Ukraine war also caused the automotive market to deeply get in the haze.S & P Global Mobility, the Global Credit Rating Corporation, announced on Wednesday (March 17) that due to the influence of the Russian war, the global light vehicle production estimates in 2022 and 2023 will be repaired by 2.6 million vehicles, each, each, each, each, each, each81.6 million and 88.5 million.All sectors speculate that because the electronic wiring beams used by many car manufacturers, that is, the wiring of each electric equipment in the car comes from Ukraine, which will make the shortage of key car parts more serious.In response, Herbert Diess, the CEO of Volkswagen, said that the company was transferring some production lines from Europe to North America and China in response to the broken chain of car production lines caused by the Russian and Ukraine war.However, Hu Ping of \"Beijing Spring\" warned that the move may add the risk of theft of German car manufacturers.\\n\\nHu Ping said: \"Moving factories and supply chains to China is huge risks. Like the German automotive industry, the Chinese market is seriously dependent on the Chinese market, so the Chinese will use the professional knowledge to collect () to market your technologyFrom your learning and stealing technology to create your own brand and cause severe challenges to German cars.\\n\\nCai Mingfang of Tamkang University in Taiwan said that even if some European or international companies intend to increase their capacity in China due to Russia and Ukraine, they will only accelerate the global capital in recent years by the global epidemic and the influence of China\\'s economy in recent years.In the long run, China may not be profitable in the long run.\\n\\nCai Mingfang said; \"The epidemic makes it unlikely to put all production lines in the same place. After the Lithuanian incident, (the European Union) believes that they need to adopt anti -economic coercion policies to China. Of course, in China, it (foreign -funded enterprise (foreign -funded enterprises) The most important thing is the domestic demand of the market (satisfying) the domestic demand, these auto manufacturers will continue to produce in China.I will not want everyone to go to China because of the Russian and Ukraine War. \"\\n\\nThe Chinese epidemic explosion Xi Jinping\\'s prestige is damaged?\\n\\nNot only did China have surged in cases of Jilin Province, but Shenzhen, Guangdong, and Hong Kong, etc., have been severely damaged by the Omikon virus.\\n\\nThe outbreak of the Hong Kong epidemic caused the Chief Executive Lin Zheng Yue\\'e to fall to the bottom of the valley.According to the polls released by the Institute of Public Opinion in Hong Kong, Lin Zhengyue\\'s scores and support rates have fallen sharply, reaching 26.6 points and 67 percentage points, which has set a new low in the past two years.\\n\\nLin Zhengyue has plummeted due to the epidemic polls, and the outside world is also curious. Will the Chinese epidemic explode, will the prestige of Chinese President Xi Jinping fall?In this regard, Hu Ping of \"Beijing Spring\" gives a positive answer.\\n\\nHu Ping said: \"Xi Jinping attributed China\\'s success in the previous stage to prevent and control epidemic. In turn, if there is a significant problem in China\\'s prevention and treatment epidemic in the future, of course, it will of course have a considerable impact on his power.The problem now is that the zero cost of China is too high, so that the society will pay a heavy price.There will be a large area of \\u200b\\u200binfection, which will also cause a lot of people to die, so Xi Jinping will definitely feel the challenge. \"\\n\\nHowever, Cai Mingfang of Taiwan Tamkang University has different views.He said that even if China was in the early 2020 epidemic prevention work, Xi Jinping\\'s power was still as stable as Taishan. Now even if the epidemic prevention is lost, as long as Beijing has strengthened remarks, it may not greatly damage Xi Jinping\\'s power or prestige.\\n\\nCai Mingfang said: \"They (China) is still a country where the message is relatively blocked. The Communist society uses the power of the country and the power of the party to find ways to flatten some bad news. If it really affects him (Xi Jinping)If prestigious, it should have affected it long ago. After all, when the epidemic in Wuhan just broke out, the impact was the greatest. It seems that Xi Jinping\\'s power is getting more and more stable, and there is no more unstable situation.Chinese time'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-03-22 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'On March 20, Shanghai reported on the prevention and control of new crown pneumonia -

The Shanghai epidemic prevention and control encountered new challenges. The number of cases continued to rise significantly. A female nurse was rejected by the hospital and died by the hospital, causing strong response.The National Health and Health Commission of China reported that 1,366 new cases nationwide, including 1301 local infection cases, and 3622 cases of asymptomatic infection.The two new cases and asymptomatic cases are added, with a total of 4,988 new cases.China\\'s new case figures do not include asymptomatic cases, but internationally, most countries calculate these two categories into new cases.The epidemic report of the China Health and Health Commission said that local infection cases are mainly concentrated in Jilin Province and Shanghai.576 cases of Changchun City, Jilin, 528 cases of Jilin City, and 6 cases in Siping, a total of 1110 cases.There are only 27 cases in Shanghai.However, there were as many as 1582 newly added cases in Shanghai, a significant increase from the 979 cases of the previous day. These asymptomatic cases were distributed in 16 districts including Minhang, Pudong New District and Xuhui.China has always adhered to the \"clear zero\" resistance method. When the new case reaches a certain number of regulations, the local authorities can take urban seal measures, and at the same time, the entire staff testing and isolation of those who detect positives.Shanghai is the only metropolis in China to refuse to implement the zero policy.For a long time, Shanghai has insisted on precise prevention and control. If a building discovered an epidemic, a building was blocked and a community found a problem. It would control a community and try not to take large -scale urban measures to reduce the impact on economic activities on economic activities. EssenceHowever, a few days ago, at the epidemic prevention and control meeting held by the State Council of the Chinese State Council, the approach to Shanghai was not named, called \"playing small smart\" and \"another set\".Under the pressure of Beijing, Shanghai\\'s measures in the new wave of epidemic prevention seem to be more severe than in the past.This also caused stronger dissatisfaction of local residents.Residents complained about the extension of travel restrictions every two days, and repeatedly complained.The British Guardian quoted a local resident and said, \"The policy changes every day, and the price is rising every day. I have to grab the food at five o\\'clock every morning. Treating the people like this.The incident that the nurse died because of the timely treatment reminded people of unfortunate incidents of unfortunate incidents during Wuhan and Xi\\'an.Xi\\'an was more than a month at the end of last year. A pregnant woman was rejected when she went to the hospital to produce and died of abortion at the gate of the hospital.Another elderly man died of rejection due to his heart and the hospital.These artificial tragedies have aroused condemnation of public opinion nationwide, and also make people more clearly see the serious disadvantages of this kind of strict city prevention and control measures themselves.Recently, there have been videos about the dissatisfaction of the people on the Internet and frequent virus testing on the Internet.The video shows that people in Shenyang, Shenzhen and other places smashed the windows of the shops and had physical conflicts with epidemic prevention personnel.No media available resources in China Time'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-03-27 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': \"China 4,500 daily case number 27 Mar - China's Shanghai To Impose Phased Lockdown To Curb Covid Outbreak\", 'Translated_Content': nan}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-03-27 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'Shanghai, March 26, 2022, 45 new local asymptomatic infections were confirmed with local COVID-19 pneumonia ... - Shanghai Municipal Health Commission', 'Translated_Content': \"Error: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='wsjkw.sh.gov.cn', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /xwfb/20220327/d890a58b77654f1fac71dad84eedce4c.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7c4582561870>, 'Connection to wsjkw.sh.gov.cn timed out.

As of April 5, the number of non -symptoms reported during this round of epidemic accounted for more than 95%of the total number of cases.In Shanghai\\'s official \"epidemic report\", confirmed cases are reported separately from those with no symptoms.An asymptomatic infection cases have not been included in the total number of diagnosis, but they are also excluded in the daily confirmed case notification of the National Health and Health Commission of China.This makes the total number of official confirmation cases reported by China ’s daily reports far less than the actual number of positive personnel who infected the new crown virus.People in a residential area in Shanghai are lined up as nucleic acids.(AP: Cheng Si) ABC Chinese cannot confirm whether China is currently the only country that does not include asymptomatic infection into the total number of diagnosis cases, but no other countries have adopted similar practices.According to the guidance of the World Health Organization (WHO), infected with symptoms or not, infected people can spread new coronal viruses.In Shanghai, although the asymptomatic infection is not considered a confirmed case, it is also required to accept concentrated isolation. It is not until the two nucleic acid sampling negatives that intervals more than 24 hours to return home.So, is the asymptomatic infected case of a new crown diagnosis?What are the risks of China ’s dispels when the number of diagnostic diagnosis is confirmed?With the deterioration of the epidemic, Shanghai has taken stricter control measures on multiple under the jurisdiction.(AP: Cheng Si) The so -called \"asymptomatic infected person\" usually refers to people who have infected with new coronal virus, but have never appeared during the infection.The definition of Chinese health authorities in the asymptomatic infection is different from the definition of WHO.The World Health Organization (WHO) determines that \"asymptomatic\" infected people refer to people who have been infected but have never experienced any symptoms.According to the Shanghai Health Department in early March, asymptomatic infections refer to \"infection with new coronal viruses, the detection of new coronary virus nucleic acid testing is positive, but there is no relevant symptoms, and there is no characteristic change in the characteristics of the pulmonary imaging.\"China Official Media CCTV also posted a post saying that the new crown test is positive infected, as long as the fever, dry cough, fatigue, sore throat, smell (taste) decrease, diarrhea and other symptoms, CT imaging non -pneumonia imaging characteristics,It cannot be included in the confirmed case.The \"New Crown Virus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Plan (Seventh Edition)\" issued by the National Health and Health Commission determined that asymptomatic infected people were \"two cases.\"\"First, after 14 days of isolation medicine observation, there are no symptoms and signs that can be self -perception or clinical recognition; the second is the\" asymptomatic infection \"state in the incubation period,\" this \"Plan\" wrote.The latest \"New Coronatte Virus Pneumonia Diagnosis Plan (Trial Ninth Edition)\" released by the China Health and Health Commission does not include this explanation.CCTV explains the distinction between \"confirmed cases\" and \"asymptomatic infection\".(Source: CCTV.com) Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) provides guidance information for the Australian health department.The guidance documents issued by the agency have not made specific regulations on the definition of asymptomatic infections.But asymptomatic infected people are included in the total number of \"confirmed cases\" in Australia.Dr. Joshu Szany, a clinical medical expert at the University of Melbourne and the Global Health School of Health (School of Popuration and Global Health), said that the \"asymptomatic\" case judged by Australia in clinical is a polymerase chain test (PCR) test (PCR).Or Fast Antigen Detection (RAT) is positive but does not show any symptoms.“从澳大利亚的角度来说，我们是把所有检测结果为阳性的病例都计算进去，尽管一些人是没症状的。 “所以举个例子，如果一个人做了PCR测试，人没症状，但是核酸Detection is positive -then in Australia, this person will be counted as a case, \"Dr. Zani said.

This conceptual confusion caused Shanghai to record a large number of \"asymptomatic cases\"One of the main reasons.\"Are they asymptomatic? Or is they not symptoms yet?\" Professor Tur said.\"When all the population is tested, many cases that are just infected will be detected. These people have not developed symptoms, but there may be symptoms in the future.\"Professor Prof. Michael Toole AM.(SUPPLIED) At present, WHO has not yet published specific data on the proportion of new crown -free infections worldwide.However, several studies have comprehensively analyzed the infection data of various countries, and the approximate proportion of asymptomatic infections has been calculated.According to a study on the website of the Journal of the American Medical Association at the end of last year, about 40.5%of the number of new crown -free infections worldwide in the world accounted for 40.5%.The study was completed by researchers from the School of Public Health of Peking University.A total of 77 early research data were analyzed, involving 19,884 samples.The research report shows that the comprehensive percentage of asymptomatic infection is about 46%in North America, 44%in Europe, and 28%in Asia.The Australian Federal Election is imminent.

The positive Ruian immortal descending case was returned to Ruian on March 28 by D3141.On April 1st, two positive infections were found in the centralized isolation point of Lucheng District.On April 2, Cangnan County found a case of new crown pneumonia. The positive sieve was found. On the evening of March 30, D3141 returned to Cangnan.On April 3rd, Yueqing found a case of new crown pneumonia. It was also returned to Yue on March 30.Jiang Xiangao said that two of the five cases were clearly infected in the train.There are also several cases that are not excluding the possibility of infection before moving the vehicle.Taking the Ruian case as an example, the D3141 vehicle is the same as the confirmed cases in foreign provinces and are adjacent compartments.So, how did they be infected on motorcycles?Jiang Xiangao analyzed that there are 4 parts of \"loopholes\".One is the process of getting on and off the car. The personnel are dense. For example, the confirmed cases of the Ruian case and the adjacent compartment are from the same door, and walk to the left and right compartments.The probability is very high.The second is to take off the mask to drink water or eat in the car. The longer the exposure time, the greater the chance of recruiting.The third is the door handle of the bathroom. When the diagnosis is confirmed, the door handle is touched when the toilet. Other personnel may be in contact with the virus from the door handle. If they do not do it in time, they may be infected.The fourth is a long journey. Occasionally pulling the mask or not standardizing the mask on the seat may also be exposed to the virus, causing infection.Do these two steps to the maximum likely to avoid being infected with frequent recruitment of trains. How to protect it when riding?In this regard, Jiang Xiangao believes that in the current special period, two steps are needed to be strictly done in order to protect himself at the greatest.The first is to standardize the medical surgical mask throughout the process; the other is to wash your hands or clean the disinfectant with free disinfection plants on the way. When touching the seat and bathroom door handle, you can use paper towels or one -time gloves.Experts further explained that wearing medical masks throughout the process, that is, it is best to try not to drink water and eat, and try to staggered the time of others to eat for a long time.If you find that there are symptoms such as cough and runny nose in the front and rear rows, you should be more careful. The mask is clamped to the bridge of the nose. From entering the station to reach the destination, you can wear a mask throughout the journey, and must be a mask at the medical surgery and above.Hand -to -hand washing means that after touched the seat armrests, door handles and other objects, wash your hands with the flowing water on the car, or quickly disinfect the hand with the disinfection of disinfection.Do not touch the surface of the mask with your hands.It is best to keep a certain distance from others and do not stack crowded.In addition to taking personal protection measures in the car, it is best to do nucleic acid testing immediately after getting off the bus.Before the results come out, do not go to public places.Jiang Xiangao said that from the recent positive cases, the personnel who have taken the train are key personnel.Nucleic acid testing can find out risk personnel, early discovery, early treatment, and early blocking the spread of society, so as not to hide the spread of the overall transmission to make the epidemic prevention situation passive.Try to reduce the flow is to protect himself and protect his family Jiang Xiangao, and advocate reducing flow, especially those in high -risk areas. It is a professional suggestion based on the current situation and environment.At present, the number of new local infections in my country remains high, and more than 20 provinces have also reported that the status of the local epidemic is still continuing.\"In general, the situation of the epidemic has not yet improved.\" At this time, travel, flow, hidden dangers and risks are everywhere.For individuals, the chance of being infected was greatly increased.Once the flow is not found in time, it will first be transmitted to the close contact with family members, relatives and friends, and it is also easy to cause hidden communication in the community.I really need to choose private cars or self -driving when traveling.After the infection that everyone cares about, what is the condition of the diagnosis?Jiang Xiangao said that only three of the six patients were torture.Among them, the symptoms of mild patients are still obvious, \"Therefore, it is not time for the new crown virus to take it lightly.\" Source: Xinhuanet, Wenzhou News Client copyright and exemption of copyright statement: All source is \"intersection, Xinhua Daily Daily, Xinhua DailyThe manuscript of its sub -newspaper \"or\" Xinhua Newspaper Network \"is an exclusive copyright of Xinhua Newspaper.

The city police department spelled out the restrictions that most of the 25 million residents are facing and called on them to “fight the epidemic with one heart … and work together for an early victory.” “Those who violate the provisions of this notice will be dealt with in strict accordance with the law by public security organs … If it constitutes a crime, they will be investigated according to law,” the department said in a statement. The financial and commercial hub is under huge pressure to try to contain China’s biggest\\xa0COVID-19\\xa0outbreak since the coronavirus was first discovered in the city of Wuhan, some 800 km (500 miles) to the west, in late 2019. Shanghai\\xa0police also banned cars from the roads apart from those involved in epidemic prevention work or transporting people in need of emergency medical treatment. They also warned increasingly frustrated residents, millions of whom are confined to their homes and struggling to get hold of daily supplies, not to spread false information or forge road passes or other clearance certificates. Shanghai\\xa0reported 25,141 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases for Tuesday, April 12, up from 22,348 a day earlier, and symptomatic cases also jumped to 1,189 from 994, city authorities said. Shanghai’s\\xa0COVID\\xa0measures, which reflect China’s strict “zero-COVID” approach aimed at eliminating transmission chains, have reverberated through the global economy, with analysts warning they were not only hurting tourism and hospitality but also having an impact on supply chains across sectors. At least 11 Taiwanese companies, mostly making parts for electronics, said on Wednesday they ere suspending production because of the disruption from China’s\\xa0COVID\\xa0controls. However, the Caixin media group reported that\\xa0Shanghai\\xa0was one of eight cities involved in a pilot scheme to loosen quarantine requirements, citing a government plan set out in a document that has not been formally published. The scheme began on Monday, April 11, and will shorten centralized quarantine requirements from 14 to 10 days, Caixin said.

of the Shanghai New Guan Guan Pneumonia epidemic on the 17th, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Health Commission saidThe proportion of positive infections found in risk people is

pneumonia and 21582 cases of asymptomatic infections.307 confirmed cases and 415 asymptomatic infected infected were found in nucleic acid screening of relevant risks.Wu Jinglei explained that in 3238 cases of confirmed cases, 1754 cases were found in closed -loop isolation control, and 307 cases were found in the screening of nucleic acid screening in related risks that 1177 cases of asymptomatic infected were transferred to confirmed cases. Actual newly added confirmed cases.For 2061 cases.He said that Shanghai focuses on key points and partitions. The implementation of nucleic acid screening is the main and supplemented by antigen screening. Persons in the seal control areas, management and control areas, and prevention areas will implement all employee testing and screening.Investigate the results, dynamically adjust the \"three districts\", and strive to achieve zero social clearing goals in the shortest time.At present, there are 16 cases of severe cases treated in hospitals.Wu Jinglei said that of the 16 cases of heavy cases, the youngest was 33 years old, and the others were over 70 years old.Of the 16 people, only one was vaccinated throughout the process, and the others had not vaccinated the new coronary pneumonia virus vaccine.Wu Jinglei said that the 33 -year -old patient suffered from serious autoimmune diseases, and his immune function decreased very obviously. At the same time, he had a bad kidney function and required hemodialysis to maintain it.At present, after active antiviral treatment, combined with Chinese medicine treatment, patients\\' lung imaging has improved, and related basic diseases are still active treatment.Other elderly patients with severe disease have serious basic diseases.He said that in accordance with the principle of \"one person, one plan\", designated hospitals increased the power of treatment and carried out consultations for multi -disciplinary experts. For severe patients, accompanied by serious basic diseases, while actively treating new crown pneumonia, it was given ventilation ventilation and in vitro in vitro.Modular lung (ECMO), antiviral, anti -infection, symptomatic nutritional support and other treatment.Wu Jinglei said that designated hospitals pay special attention to the treatment of these critical patients, and it has an advantageous advantage with modern medical western medicine.Medical staff also pay special attention to observing the changes in the condition of patients with severe illnesses, and carry out treatment.Nucleic acid testing is an important means of preventing and controlling the prevention and control of new coronal virus infection.At present, Shanghai is still conducting high frequency repeated nucleic acid testing?Gao Chunfang, director of the Inspection Experimental Center of Yueyang Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said that repeated testing is very necessary for those who discover positive infections.Through crowd nucleic acid testing, cases can be found as soon as possible, especially those with non -symptoms, to find out and lock risk areas and key groups, and take targeted control measures in a timely manner to block the spread of the epidemic.Gao Chunfang said that in terms of clinical diseases and development rules, any disease primary infection has a certain incubation period, and the new crown is no exception, and there are certain individual differences in the duration of the incubation period.In terms of detection technology, there is a concept of detection window period.After the virus is infected, there is a growth and replication process in the body. The virus load in the early stage of the infection is too low, which is lower than the lower limit of the detection. The positive cannot be found. This time period is the detection window period.The expert said that the incubation period+detection window period enables the positive results in the early stage of the infection. Repeated detection can increase the chance of positive discovery and discover positive in time.It is reported that due to the sampling of the respiratory pathogen, there are several forms of throat, nose, nose+nose+pharynx, and the sampling process inevitably has a certain sampling difference.This difference includes sampling parts, depth, and the amount of secretions collected.Therefore, repeated multiple sampling detections can make up for the false negative effects that the sampling error may bring.Gao Chunfang said that in addition, for those who have already been infected, during the development of the disease, through repeated testing, the monitoring load changes, it provides a good indicator for predicting the therapeutic effects and recovery status of the infected person.Repeated tests are conventional methods confirmed by clinical pathogens. For example, clinically, other infectious diseases such as urinary tract infections and blood circuit infections usually need to be trained (more than three times) to confirm the positive pathogen and achieve precise treatment.(over)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHolocaust of the Holocatus Family Festival held the Danjiangkou Reservoir \"Guardian\" 2024 World Internet Conference Wuzhen Summit 2024 National Network Security Propaganda Week 7th China International Import Expo 2024 China -Africa Cooperation Forum Summit Entrusted Powerful Country Road Polish. 2024China Network Civilization Conference'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-17 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'The proportion of positive infected people found in shanghai among the at-risk population is declining;', 'Translated_Content': 'The reporter learned from the press conference of the Shanghai New Crown Pneumonia Epidemic Epidemium on April 17 that on April 16, 3,238 newly added local diagnosis cases of new crown pneumonia and 21,582 cases of non -symptoms were added to Shanghai.Among the 21582 cases of asymptomatic infection, 21167 were found in closed -loop isolation control, and 415 cases were found in the screening of related risks.The Shanghai Municipal Committee of Health and Health said that the proportion of positive infections found in risks in risks is declining.The number of positive infections discovered in the past two days is still high, but it has remained relatively stable.(Reporter Yuan Quan and Hu Jiefei)'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-17 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'Update on the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia as of 24:00 on April 16 -

Because this is a virus that the Shanghai government warns that it can cause serious consequences for the people - otherwise why they are blockedWhat is the image source, Getty Images Reuters on April 17 quoted two anonymous sources saying that Shanghai City had set the goal of \"no covid\" to Covid in the community \".China about the \"non -community\" situation means that no new cases appear outside the isolation area.And began to return to normal life. The Beijing government intervened with Shanghai in early April after this financial center failed to isolate Covid by blocking the city in each stage.Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized that China must not loosen measures to deal with Covid.Shanghai captured blockade the East from March 28 and expanded to the whole city from April 1.Although the measures are limited to travel with some people who have been loosened last week, most businesses are still closed and public transport is still suspended.Since the large outbreak due to the Omiron strain three weeks ago, Shanghai city was blocked tightly, causing residents to be angry.Millions of people have been locked in the house, anyone with positive test results will be sent to isolation centers.In recent weeks, many people complain about limitations and lack of food on social networks.People have to place food and drink food and wait for the government to bring vegetables, meat and eggs, analysts that many people are depleting food.The expansion blockade causes delivery services, grocery stores and even the Government\\'s distribution overloaded.With more than 20,000 new cases of infection every day, authorities are struggling to get enough rooms.Exhibition centers and schools turn into isolation centers, temporary hospitals have been established in recent weeks.The increase in the number of Covids in China recently, although small compared to some other countries, is a great challenge with China\\'s \"Covid\" strategy, making the country different from.Most other countries are trying to live with the virus.With the higher transmission capacity and causing lighter symptoms of the Omicron variant have asked whether China\\'s current strategy is sustainable for a long time.© 2024 BBC.BBC is not responsible for the content of the external pages.Learn how we approach the outside page'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-18 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'The Daily || The Corona Virus ॥ 3 killed in Shanghai, China', 'Translated_Content': 'Dhaka, Bangladesh Monday 12 December 21222, 1 Prahayana.\\n\\n\\nMonday 12 December 2021, 1 Prahayana 1\\nPublished: 1:19, 1 April 21222 More Read the death of 5 people by eating turtle meat.The deceased was the approval of the highest military budget for Russia to prohibit the mosque in Israel, the editor, printer and publisher: Shamima A Khan.The editor is printed and published by the Globe Printers Ltd and Janakantha Ltd, a member of the Globe Janakantha Industrial Family.Regi: No. DA1.© 2021 |The Daily Janakantha is the best reserved.Top News in Development Immerse.com:'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-18 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'The Daily || The Corona Virus ॥ 3 killed in Shanghai, China', 'Translated_Content': 'Dhaka, Bangladesh Monday 12 December 21222, 1 Prahayana.\\n\\n\\nMonday 12 December 2021, 1 Prahayana 1\\nPublished: 1:19, 1 April 21222 More Read the death of 5 people by eating turtle meat.The deceased was the approval of the highest military budget for Russia to prohibit the mosque in Israel, the editor, printer and publisher: Shamima A Khan.The editor is printed and published by the Globe Printers Ltd and Janakantha Ltd, a member of the Globe Janakantha Industrial Family.Regi: No. DA1.© 2021 |The Daily Janakantha is the best reserved.Top News in Development Immerse.com:'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-18 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'Three coronavirus deaths recorded in new wave -

BEIJING (AP) â€” Shanghai authorities on Monday reported the first COVID-19 deaths of the latest outbreak in China\\'s most populous and wealthiest city. All three who died were elderly, had underlying diseases such as diabetes and hypertension and had not been vaccinated against the coronavirus, city Health Commission inspector Wu Ganyu told journalists. \"After entering hospital, their conditions grew worse and they died after attempts to save them were unsuccessful,\" Wu said. The deaths raise to 4,641 the number of people China says have succumbed to the disease since the virus was first detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019. Most of Shanghai\\'s 25 million residents are being confined to their homes for a third week as China continues to employ a \"zero-tolerance\" strategy to curb the outbreak, demanding isolation of anyone possibly infected. China on Monday said 23,362 people had tested positive for the virus over the previous 24 hours, most of them showing no symptoms and almost all of them in Shanghai. The city has reported more than 300,000 cases since late March. Shanghai began easing restrictions last week, although officials have warned the city doesn\\'t have its outbreak under control. Shanghai, which is home to China\\'s biggest port and most important stock exchange, appeared unprepared for such a massive undertaking. Residents ran short of food and daily necessities while enduring lockdown conditions, and tens of thousands of people put under medical observation have been sequestered in crowded facilities where lights are always on, garbage bins overflow, food is inadequate and hot showers nonexistent. Anyone who tests positive but has few or no symptoms is required to spend one week in a quarantine facility. Concerns have risen about the economic impact of the government\\'s hardline policy. China\\'s economic growth edged up to a still-weak 4.8% over a year earlier in the first three months of 2022 as lockdowns cut production in major industrial cities. Official data showed growth accelerated from the previous quarter\\'s 4%. While the ruling Communist Party has urged more targeted prevention measures, local officials have routinely adopted stringent regulations, possibly for fear of being fired or penalized over outbreaks in their areas. In the city of Wenzhou, which has seen only a handful of cases, authorities have authorized rewards of up to 50,000 yuan ($7,800) for information about people who falsify their health status, online news site The Paper reported.

infected.How does the whole city of Shanghai eliminate viruses?Recently, Shanghai will continue to start the \"environmental anti -kill prevention war\", and once again starts the half -month environmental elimination assault operation.It is reported that the assault operation focused on the three major tasks -the full coverage of the Xinlou building, the large -scale rinse of the urban public environment, and the continuous development of the top ten key places to prevent the disinfecting.How to solve the disappearance of the building where the positive infected person is located? In the full coverage operation of the Xinlou building, the districts and streets in Shanghai have formed the anti -killing team to target the public areas in the Xinlou Building. Clean the disinfecting of key points.Shanghai also further improved the process of eliminating the disinfecting process of the Xinlou Building. After discovering that the positive infection was found, the street town eliminating teams were promptly disinfected in accordance with the technical specifications of the public areas of the building.After the positive infected person is transferred, the building is disinfected by the professional team.After the end of the end, the environment is basically resumed, and the property service enterprise will be restored to the daily general and preventive disinfection of the building, and keep the building clean and hygienic.There are both professionals and many volunteers in the disinfecting team.In order to improve the team\\'s operation ability, Shanghai also specially produced short videos of the \"Points for Disinfection on the Sterilization of Community Positive Buildings\", which has compiled simple and easy -to -understand live operation concise reminders to conduct skill training for these teams.How should home and office venues be correctly eliminated? First, the principle of cleaning and disinfection is supplemented: Under normal circumstances, citizens should carry out disinfection work with risky links and objects under the premise of cleaning.Second, the principles of physical methods and supplemented by chemical methods are supplemented: priority use of disinfection methods such as opening windows ventilation, mechanical ventilation, heating boiling, sunlight sun exposure.Third, the principle of combining preventive disinfection and disinfection at any time: Do a good job of disinfection work such as all kinds of items, elevators, armrests, and bathrooms daily, 1 to 2 times a day.If pollution occurs, citizens should be disinfected at any time and do well in hand cleaning at any time.Fourth, the principle of consistent disinfection intensity and risk is consistent with the high and low risk: frequent contact frequency can be higher, and the disinfection concentration with severe pollution is appropriately increased, and the disinfection time is appropriately extended.Express parcels finally go to the hands of the citizens through warehousing, logistics, and communities. How to do a good job in the process? The first link is the source. Environmental disinfecting, strengthening preventive disinfection on the facilities and equipment of commercial shelves, carts, air conditioners, and other facilities.The second link is logistics. Express packages will strictly implement \"disinfection and then dividing\". Express vehicles or electric bicycles will also be fully disinfected every day.The third link is that after the goods arrive in the community, they will be received through no contact. The property staff must spray disinfection of the outer packaging, and it must disinfect at least 2 times to the courier rack and the surrounding environment every day.The last part is that the residents collect the goods. Citizens need to wear masks and gloves when taking courier and goods. After taking home, they will spray or wipe and disinfect the outer packaging.Outside the door.If it is a fresh food, citizens can rinse or soak and dry it with slow water flowing.After the processing is over, clean your hands in time.About Us | Foreign Propaganda Service and Advertising Services |\\r\\nIllegal and bad information report Tel: 010-88828271 Reporting Process All rights reserved China Internet News Center Email: News@china.org.cn Tel: 86-10-88828000 Beijing ICP Certificate 0400890105123'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-19 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'CORONAVIRUS: THREE PEOPLE DIE IN SHANGHAI - BBC NEWS ARABIC', 'Translated_Content': 'The photo was released, Getty Images announced the death of three people as a result of the injury to the Coffee-19 in Shanghai, for the first time since it entered the city, which is the financial center of China, closing in late March.A press release issued by the city\\'s health commission said that the victims ranged between the ages of 89 and 91 years and were unacceptable.Shanghai officials said only 38 percent of the population over the age of 60 have full pollination doses.The city is now scheduled to witness another round of mass vaccination, which means that strict closure will continue for a fourth week for most of the population.So far, China has been emphasizing that no one was death as a result of the city\\'s cavid, which has become increasingly doubt.The deaths announced today, Monday, were the first associated with Kofid, which are officially recognized by the Chinese authorities throughout the country since March 2020. The Health Commission in Shanghai said in a statement of announcing deaths that the three people died in the hospital on Sunday despite \"all efforts to revive them.\"She added that the three people were suffering from chronic health problems.Clashes in Shanghai as a result of the general closure to reduce the spread of the Corona virus, the closure of Shanghai, shakes the economy of China and the world, expanding the closure of Corona in Shanghai to include the entire city and live Shanghai in light of a strict closure since the discovery of the widespread of the hostel Omekron three weeks ago, which angered the population.Millions were forced to commit their homes, and anyone comes as a result of a positive virus test that is sent to quarantine centers.In recent weeks, many have resorted to social media to complain about restrictions and lack of food.People were forced to seek food and water and wait for the government\\'s distribution to homes such as vegetables, meat and eggs, and analysts say that many suffer from the depletion of supplies.The closure extension created very great pressure on home delivery services and grocery store sites and even government supplies distribution service.But with the appearance of more than 20 thousand new injuries per day, the authorities find it difficult to deal with the outbreak.In recent weeks, the city has transformed exhibition halls and schools into quarantine centers, and established temporary hospitals.The recent rise in cases in China, although small compared to some countries, was a major challenge to China\\'s strategy known as \"Safar Kovid\", which uses rapid closures and severe restrictions to contain any spread of the disease.This policy distinguished China from most other countries trying to coexist with the virus.But the increased speed of the transition and the lighter risk of the mosque omecron has led to questions about whether the current strategistics can survive in the long term.Written by: Robin Brant, BBC correspondent in Shanghai, that the timing of this announcement is strange.First, because, until this moment, if someone believed that in a city with a population of approximately 25 million people, no one would have died in this wave of the virus, this would have been naive to understand.But secondly, which is the most important, we know that people have already died after suffering a cavid during this spread.We have published a news.This happened to dozens of elderly patients in one hospital in Shanghai.But it was not official deaths in Kofid, according to the authorities.They were apparently dominated by chronic health problems.So what has changed?The answer is that it does not seem to have changed something with regard to clinical assessment operations.People with chronic health problems died after the results of their testing of the virus were positive, but the death rate of the Zero was zero.Now three people died in very similar circumstances, but the outcome of the official deaths increased this time.It is normal for the question to be asked, is this because the authorities decided that they need to announce the risks of this wide wave of the virus that barely half of the Chinese who are over the age of 60 years of immunization against him?And because until now this was the virus that the Chinese authorities have warned that it might destroy the residents- otherwise why would they close the city if it was otherwise- yet no one has been officially dead.© 2024 BBC.BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Our policy regarding external links.'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-19 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'China reports first 3 deaths in Shanghai COVID outbreak , fueling skepticism over official numbers', 'Translated_Content': 'Error 404: Unable to fetch content'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-19 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'China reports first 3 deaths in Shanghai COVID outbreak , fueling skepticism over official numbers', 'Translated_Content': 'Experts questioned the accuracy of China\\'s reporting of COVID-19 deaths. HONG KONG -- China has reported its first three deaths linked to the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai, as the country battles its worst surge of infections since the pandemic began. According to a statement on Monday from the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, the people who died on Sunday were aged between 89 and 91. All of them were unvaccinated. As Shanghai’s 25 million residents enter a third week of lockdown, the city on Monday recorded 22,248 new cases, 2,417 of which were symptomatic. The official death toll, which is remarkably lower than those in other major cities, has fueled skepticism of the official data coming out of China. Some experts suspect that China is attributing underlying health conditions to COVID deaths. Yanzhong Huang, a Senior Fellow for Global Health at the Council on Foreign Relations pointed to a Shanghai study that estimates there were more than 2,000 excess diabetes deaths in Shanghai associated with the lockdown. Anger over the country’s hardline \"Zero COVID\" approach to the pandemic has been swelling in the country, particularly in Shanghai where residents have experienced food shortages and delivery difficulties. The economic costs are also growing as the lockdown impacts the flow of goods to major shipping ports, posing disruptions to global supply chains. On Monday, China’s State Council Vice-Premier Liu He, an economic advisor to Chinese President Xi Jinping, said that China must stabilize its supply chains with the help of local governments. Meanwhile, Shanghai’s Economic and Information Technology Commission announced plans to resume production and ease controls on manufacturers. Data released on Monday showed a significant slowdown in the country’s economic activity in March. Shanghai contributes to about a third of China’s gross domestic product. “We should solve outstanding problems one by one in key regions,” Liu said, according to Xinhua News Agency. Liu said the government will establish a so-called “white list” of companies that require assistance in recovering from disruptions. Speaking with ABC News, Huang also voiced concern that prolonged lockdowns could hurt China’s competitiveness in the lockdown. “When other countries are now learning to coexist with the virus and their economy and the manufacturing capacity is recovering, China\\'s export sector will be affected,” Huang said. Huang added that it’s time for China to move away from its 2020 tactics: “Over the past two years, the Zero COVID strategy was effective in sustaining extremely low levels of infection in helping China fight this, to boost its reputation as a success by pandemic response. But now this approach are showing diminishing returns. The social economic costs associated with the approach are rising rapidly and exponentially.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-19 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'COVID-19/Local +1626 Reached a New High! 2 new severe case deaths - Heho Health;', 'Translated_Content': 'BMI computer HOT body fat rate computer HOT looking for the BMR/TDEE computer HOT drug query Finding Pharmaceutical Bureau BMI computer HOT BMR/TDEE computer fat rate computer hot Special issue Activities Special Zone Discussion Area Face -brain/Neck/chest and abdominal urinary/reproductive system Skin/skeletal/muscle endocrine/immune system common symptoms of new crown symptoms, allergic cough headache, scientific research new inferior medicine safety, Chinese medicine, body medicine, body health psychological health mental health mental health Parenting parent -child health slow and old reproductive medical doctor life disaster response\\nMedical Dynamic Doctors said that Chinese medicine practitioners said that a nutritionist said that the therapist said that the psychologist said that the nursing said that the auxiliary experts said that the summer health warfare lung chain is not non -indispensable.

All three people who died were elderly, had underlying diseases such as diabetes and hypertension and had not been vaccinated against the coronavirus, city Health Commission inspector Wu Ganyu told journalists. “After entering hospital, their conditions grew worse and they died after attempts to save them were unsuccessful,” Wu said.  The deaths raise to 4,641 the number of people that China says have succumbed to the disease since the virus was first detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019. While China has an overall vaccination rate of around 90%, a low rate among the elderly remains a concern. Only 62% of Shanghai residents over age 60 have been vaccinated, according to the latest data available. Some experts say China needs to raise that rate before it can safely live with the virus. While highly contagious, the omicron BA.2 variant driving the Shanghai outbreak is less lethal than the previous delta variant. However, China’s low death toll from COVID-19, which is blamed for more than 988,000 deaths in the United States, has raised questions about how China’s authoritarian and often highly secretive government counts such fatalities.  Most of Shanghai’s 25 million residents are being confined to their homes for a third week as China continues to employ a “zero-tolerance” strategy to curb the outbreak, demanding isolation of anyone possibly infected.  China on Monday said 23,362 people had tested positive for the virus over the previous 24 hours, most of them showing no symptoms and almost all of them in Shanghai. The city has reported more than 300,000 cases since late March. Shanghai began easing restrictions last week, although officials have warned that the city doesn’t have its outbreak under control. Shanghai, which is home to China’s biggest port and most important stock exchange, appeared unprepared for such a massive undertaking.  Residents have run short of food and other daily necessities while enduring lockdown conditions, and tens of thousands of people put under medical observation have been sequestered in crowded facilities  where lights are always on, garbage bins overflow, food is inadequate and hot showers nonexistent. Anyone who tests positive but has few or no symptoms is required to spend one week in a quarantine facility.  Concerns have risen about the economic impact of the government’s hard-line policy.  China’s economic growth edged up to a still-weak 4.8% over a year earlier in the first three months of 2022 as lockdowns cut production in major industrial cities. Official data showed growth accelerated from the previous quarter’s 4%.  At a meeting Monday, Vice Premier Liu He, President Xi Jinping’s top economic advisor, pledged increased spending to stabilize supply chains and provide financial support for health workers and others on the pandemic front lines. While the ruling Communist Party has urged more targeted prevention measures, local officials have routinely adopted stringent regulations, possibly for fear of being fired or penalized over outbreaks in their areas.  In the city of Wenzhou, which has seen only a handful of cases, authorities have authorized rewards of up to $7,800 for information about people who falsify their health status, online news site the Paper reported.

The surge in the number of severe Covid patients and the increase in death occurred when the plague itselfIt seems to subside after weeks of lockdown.The new infection has dropped for four consecutive days to 18,495 on Wednesday.The relatively large city elderly population is very vulnerable to viruses, because the level of vaccination between them remains low.Only 62 percent of the senior population has been inoculated, said Shanghai government officials.Most of the 25 people who have died are not vaccinated.With an increase in the number of severe cases, the plague can cause more deaths in Shanghai, the possibility of confirming the suspicions proposed by experts outside of China that the current plague can ultimately become more deadly than previously expected.Also read the article of vaccination gap and lack of natural immunity, because the country has mostly prevented Covid until now.In Shanghai, almost one of the five of those infected with the virus is a person aged 60 years and over, while those aged 80 years and over accounted for 2 percent of the total data, according to official data.However, the official number of Covid per capita Chinese deaths as a whole remains one of the lowest in the world, the topic that is the material that is developing because it seems that the best countries with higher vaccination are New Zealand and South Korea.Check news and other articles on google\\nNews and wa channels are comfortable without advertisements.Business subscriptions are comfortable without advertising.Business subscriptions are comfortable without advertising.Business subscriptions are comfortable without advertising.Business subscriptions are comfortable without advertising.Business subscription'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-22 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'Shanghai Considers Easing lockdown | Republika Online', 'Translated_Content': 'Translation Error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-22 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'The pandemic in Hong Kong subsides; Deaths rise in Shanghai - The San Diego Union-Tribune', 'Translated_Content': 'Translation Error: sequence item 3: expected str instance, NoneType found'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-22 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': '【Latest】Yesterday, the number of discharged cabins was 27,988, and the number of new infected people in society gradually declined - Shanghai Municipal Health Commission;', 'Translated_Content': \"Error: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response'))\"}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-23 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'The Daily || The Corona Virus ॥ 12 killed in Shanghai in one day, anger grows', 'Translated_Content': 'Dhaka, Bangladesh Monday 12 December 21222, 1 Prahayana.\\n\\n\\nMonday 12 December 2021, 1 Prahayana 1\\nPublished: 1:19, 28 Apr 21222 More Read the death of 5 people by eating turtle meat, Mamata Banerjee wants to send UN peacekeeping forces to Bangladesh in the US War.The deceased was the approval of the highest military budget for Russia to prohibit the mosque in Israel, the editor, printer and publisher: Shamima A Khan.The editor is printed and published by the Globe Printers Ltd and Janakantha Ltd, a member of the Globe Janakantha Industrial Family.Regi: No. DA1.© 2021 |The Daily Janakantha is the best reserved.Top News in Development Immerse.com:'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-23 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'Shanghai, April 22, 2022, 2736 new local COVID-19 confirmed cases of new local asymptomatic ... - Shanghai Municipal Health Commission', 'Translated_Content': \"Error: HTTPConnectionPool(host='wsjkw.sh.gov.cn', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /xwfb/20220423/803d2f7447bc44118178241a80c9c73f.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7c4581e06fe0>, 'Connection to wsjkw.sh.gov.cn timed out.

Worries that the country’s strict adherence to Covid Zero will further damage the economy dragged down stocks to oil and iron ore on Monday. It’s also sparked a bout of panic buying as Beijing residents — fearful of being caught unprepared in the event of a citywide shutdown– rushed to stock up on supplies after the government announced mass testing plans and put some areas under lockdown. The city of more than 20 million people and the country’s political center has sealed off dozens of residential compounds and told inhabitants of the eastern district of Chaoyang to be tested three times this week after dozens of infections were found over the weekend. Officials have warned of more cases in coming days, with Beijing city government spokesman Xu Hejian saying late on Friday that the current outbreak is “complex and stealthy” while vowing to take further measures to prevent its spread. Read More: The Chinese Public May Have Had Enough of Zero-COVID The flareup comes as Shanghai reported a record number of fatalities and imposed stricter rules to try and stamp out infections. The twin outbreaks in two of China’s most significant cities has become an unprecedented test for President Xi Jinping, who is likely to seek a third five-year term during a Communist Party congress later this year. China has repeatedly defended Covid Zero, saying the policy saves lives and keeps the economy going, even as the strategy increasingly darkens the country’s growth outlook and threatens to disrupt global supply chains. Chinese stocks slumped and the onshore yuan fell to its weakest in a year. Iron ore futures slumped more than 11%, while oil dropped about 3% to trade below $100 a barrel. Beijing has already locked down some residential compounds around the Chaoyang district — home to some 3.5 million people, including many expats, the central business district and most foreign embassies. It has designated 14 smaller communities as “sealed” and another 14 as “controlled” areas with different levels of movement restrictions. Local authorities will test people who live or work in Chaoyang on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. That’s everyone from white collar workers to young children who need a negative result to attend kindergarten.

Online and brick-and-mortar grocery stores have sold out of fresh food, kitchen staples and other basics like masks and antiseptic. Residents in the capital are worried about a repeat of the crisis that’s snarled Shanghai for almost a month and seen people unable to reliably access food or medical care. Beijing authorities are beefing up supplies, delivering fresh vegetables to parts of Chaoyang that have reported positive cases. Meituan and other grocery delivery apps have also increased manpower by as much as 70% to help sort mounting orders and race to deliver them to people’s doorsteps on the same day, local media reported. In Shanghai, the misery continues with officials ramping up containment efforts as cases in the community continue to crop up despite mass isolation, testing and lockdowns. Over the weekend, fences were installed in some neighborhoods to seal buildings where positive cases have been found, sparking renewed frustration among residents already stuck inside their homes for weeks. The financial hub remains the epicenter of China’s worst outbreak since Wuhan more than two years ago. It reported 51 fatalities on Sunday, mostly elderly people, which took deaths in the current wave to 138. There are 196 patients in severe condition and 23 in critical condition.

The Chinese capital lives in fear of general confinement.According to the authorities, the Asian giant has however managed to limit the total assessment to less than 5,000 dead since the appearance of the virus in late 2019 in the center of the country.The confirmed cases of contamination remain below 200,000, if we stick to the official figures which do not include asymptomatic cases.Shanghai, the hardest touched city in China by the Omicron strain, has a mortality rate of 0.036%, or 36 deaths per 100,000 positive cases since March 1.But experts are skeptical about this rate surprisingly lower than other countries, however given as an example in pandemic management, such as New Zealand (0.07%).For the epidemiologist Michael Baker, of the University of Otago in New Zealand, if Shanghai was really as efficient as his country, the metropolis should have announced \"more than 300 dead\" and not 190. Low mortality challenges, D\\'As much as vaccination rates are low in the oldest, particularly vulnerable.Chinese scientists explain this result by the \"zero covid\" strategy implemented by Beijing.This draconian method of confinements located from the appearance of a few cases and massive tests to identify contaminated and isolate people makes it possible to \"limit the contagion as much as possible and\" avoid \"a saturation of medical resources which would result in deaths,Cons up the epidemiologist Wu Zunyou, one of the Chinese figures in the fight against the virus.The repeated and large -scale screening of part of the population also increases \"the chances of detecting (early) asymptomatic or light cases, notes virologist Leong Hoe Nam, based in Singapore.According to them, it would not be mortality that would be lower than in the rest of the world, but the number of cases that would be higher in China.But the assessment in Shanghai could increase because \"there is always a gap between the identified cases and the people who fall sick and die\" of the covid, notes the epidemiologist Michael Baker.In Wuhan, the first confined city in the world in early 2020, the authorities had noted after 50% the number of deaths.But China is \"chilly\" concerning its mortality figures, AFP Ariel Karlinsky, an adviser to the World Health Organization (WHO) of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, to AFP.According to him, comparing the number of deaths all causes in China since 2020 to those of the years prior to the pandemic would give a fairer vision of the situation.But these figures were not made public.The figures in China are \"very political\", maintains the infectiologist Mai He, from the University of Washington.Especially since health measures are presented by communist power as proof of the superiority of its authoritarian political system, faced with Western democracies which record heavier balance sheets.© L\\'Express'}, {'publication-date': Timestamp('2022-04-27 00:00:00'), 'country': 'China', 'diseases_original': 'covid19', 'syndrome_title': nan, 'title': 'COVID-19 outbreak complicated in China -
